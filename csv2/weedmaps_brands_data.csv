1598,"INTRODUCING VERDE NATURAL
 
We envision a world with alternatives to pharmaceutical drugs, where you can use all natural cannabis in concert with proper diet and exercise to ease your pain and suffering. Whether you're facing a serious medical condition or simply need some relief from your strenuous job, we're giving you access to cannabis that is pure; cannabis not grown synthetically, but grown the way mother nature intended in nutrient dense soil.
 
Verde Natural is a marijuana cultivator, retailer and wholesaler based in Denver, Colorado. We grow both medical and recreational strains at our 25,000 square foot grow facility in North Denver. Medical strains are sold at our store on Colfax Avenue in Denver and we wholesale our recreational strains to stores throughout the state of Colorado. We will be opening a recreational facility in 2017 at our medical store location.
 
HOW IT ALL STARTED
 
Verde Natural was founded by Chuck Blackton (aka the Lemon Man) in 2009 as a medical dispensary in Denver, Colorado, Blackton called it the Verde Wellness Center. His vision was to create a proper dispensary where customers didn’t feel like a transaction. You see, Chuck had spent the better part of 10 years in Amsterdam learning how to run marijuana shops and curate strong genetics. With this knowledge under his belt, he wondered how he could help steer the up and coming market in Colorado in the right direction.
 
Upon his return to the states, Blackton discovered that his father had passed from Lou Gehrig's Disease (aka ALS). The passing of his father set an even deeper, emotional fire in him to enter the Colorado market, but guiding the industry towards a proper retail model was no longer at the top of his priority list. Instead he was seeking a way to help ALS sufferers and sufferers of other painful medical conditions find an alternative treatment to pharmaceuticals to ease their pain and suffering.
 
With that said, there is still a ton of research to be done on cannabis and how it can benefit those who suffer from severe medical condition. Verde truly hopes to help identify ways that cannabis can be used as an alternative to pharmaceuticals. We believe cannabis can be used, holistically, in concert with proper diet and fitness to improve and ease the pain of medical conditions. This is what drives us to make sure you have access to cannabis that is grown naturally without synthetics!
 
EXPANSION OF VERDE
 
In 2015, Verde Natural's presence in the Colorado marijuana market began to pick up. With demand increasing, new management joined Blackton to begin expanding their operations. CEO Rudy Ellenbogen completed the design and build-out of a custom 25,000 square foot grow facility. Using a bare bone warehouse, the facility was designed for a soil system with a production flow (from clone, to vegetation, to flowering) that allows for the growers to harvest every single week! The ingenious design breaks out the grow facility into multiple rooms for vegetation and around a dozen for flowering. The flow not only makes the grow facility flexible for production, but reduces the risk of significant crop loss due to pests and disease outbreak.
 
GROWING IN SOIL
 
While the new grow facility was designed in 2015, master grower Cassandra Maffey joined the new management team at Verde Natural. Cassandra brought with her a very unique soil growing system that she had just successfully implemented at Boulder Marijuana Company (BMC) in Boulder, Colorado. The soil system mimics an outdoor growing environment, making for an ideal ecosystem in which marijuana plants can thrive, unlike the common hydroponic and synthetic systems found in a majority of growing facilities across the United States today. The soil is living, meaning there are thousands of microbes milling around in the soil. Microbes are beneficial microscopic bacteria that aid the cannabis plants with nutrient uptake from the soil. Marijuana plants have evolved over thousands of years to actively communicate with these microbes. With living soil, you are allowing the plant to naturally choose when and what to eat, whereas in a hydroponic or synthetic system you force-feed the plant. Plants reach their highest potential, in terms of terpene and cannabinoid production, when you allow them to feed naturally.
 
Soil at Verde Natural is also recycled after each flower harvest! Most grow facilities will throw out their soil after every single harvest, primarily because they've riddled it with synthetic nutrients that kill off all the beneficial microbes. Our goal is to keep these microbes alive, so we do not use harsh synthetics. Instead, we use pure organic nutrients in proper amounts to ensure the plant is fed properly until harvest. In most instances, after the plant is harvested, the soil is fairly depleted of nutrients. Once we remove the root balls from the soil, the remaining stalk and roots of the marijuana plant, we test the soil to note the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels...",,881,9a/9a4f6345022e1fc561894c4d37d810c83ceba178.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/598/avatar/original/verde-natural-cannabis_logo_v2.jpg,,Verde Natural Cannabis,4.93650770187378,31,verde-natural-cannabis,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/verde-natural-cannabis,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1937, a small and powerful group of cannabis prohibitionists used their influence to push the Marihuana Tax Act into law. They used potent propaganda to change a common household remedy into a tool to send our people to prison. Stripping them of their rights, and their vote.

We believe in the power of cannabis to right those wrongs. As state over state overturns prohibition, we proudly stand for cannabis wellness, social justice and equality for all.

537,"Wana Brands has been an innovator in the Colorado infused products industry since 2010. As one of Colorado's original infused products manufacturers, Wana has developed an amazing line-up of artisan, made from scratch edibles, concentrates, and medicinal products including the state's most popular sour gummies. Wana also offers the first extended release capsule on the market, available in five THC and CBD ratios. 




When we started Wana Brands, the market for quality infused products was very limited. Right from the start, we knew that we wanted to build a brand that both patients and dispensaries could count on for professionalism, consistency, quality, and innovation. From production to packaging to working with our customers, Wana Brands is focused on these principles. To ensure consistency, Wana Brands lab tests every batch of tincture we make and adjusts the recipe based on potency to enable precise dosing - and we have done this from the day we opened our doors - many years before it was required by law. Our facility operates with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to ensure strict quality control and consumer safety. 

We also believe that eating an edible or consuming a concentrate should be a treat. We've invested in refining our recipes so that the taste of our delicious products comes through, not the taste of medicine. 




Our products are made by passionate employees who love what they do and are dedicated to providing artisan level quality. We also pride ourselves on the quality of our service. Our entire team is knowledgable, enthusiastic, and dedicated to making our partners' lives easire so they can in turn do their very best job for their customers.

8481,"Weed was created by a group of friends in San Diego who grew up skating and selling weed since the early 2000’s. The cannabis lifestyle has been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember, so it was only natural to create a brand that could be sold legally across California. 
By partnering with Ladybug Farms in Santa Cruz, California, Weed is now grown by 4th generation farmers in massive greenhouses that are harvested on a weekly cycle. This allows Weed to provide the every day smoker with fresh buds at the best prices all year long. 
We keep it simple with our branding and let our flower speak for itself. Smoking Weed will never go out of style, so we focus on the basics and pass the savings onto you. Our main goal is to provide the best bang for your buck without cutting any corners throughout the cultivation process. 
When you buy Weed, you’re supporting legacy operators who made the industry into what it is today. We’ve fought hard to make this brand into reality and we appreciate everyone who supports us by smoking Weed and rocking our merch out in the world.",,770,10/10fd01e81b3b6c1d6ee92cf0a186aa9ff080d425.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/008/481/avatar/original/1625863920-weedmaps.jpg,,Weed,4.11764717102051,2,weed,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/weed,,,,,,,,,,,,

3377,"We are a team of veteran cannabis enthusiasts and activists who recognized the absence of consistent high quality cannabis medicinal products. Our combined experience has taught us about the diverse range of cannabinoids and terpenes which interact dynamically within the cannabis plant to provide precise and thorough benefits. We aim to deliver that same multi-dimensional and intricate relationship through our unique products. Our extracts are created by top chemists and researchers whose devotion to clean medicine motivated them to develop the first and only full spectrum distillate on the market. 
 
Our philosophy is to stay as true to nature as possible and only use the best products and processes available to us. We are not simply a crude oil refinery like many companies; we always start with locally sourced fresh flowers, doing so allows us to control our quality on an unprecedented level in the cannabis distillate market. Our extractions are strain specific rather than a blended mix, which allows for truly authentic and reliable experiences with each of our products. Fresh flower extractions means that the cannabinoids remain just as potent as they were on the day of harvest. The materials used to create our products never touch any hydrocarbons, pesticides, or other harsh contaminants commonly found in various steps of other productions. 
 
Extracting cannabinoids is a complex process, distillate companies recognize this and most choose to simply extract THC with CO2. Our chemists were not satisfied with such a simple isolation and elected to create their own organic red wine based ethanol to capture the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes that this magical plant offers. We are the purest full spectrum distillate on the market and as such our products are as true to the plant as one can get. We work rigorously to ensure our products meet or exceed industry standards for safety, quality, and potency. Just like our strain specific extractions, each batch is independently tested by certified labs in order to ensure our products are free of any pesticides, microbials, solvents, or any other impurities. 
 
Products:
 
Our product line is ever expanding, we currently have cartridges, distillate jars, battery kits, and infused organic freeze dried fruit slices. 
 
Strains: Our current strain line up from Sativa to Indica is:
 
Super Sour Diesel - 100% Sativa
 
Tangie - 70:30 Satvia Dominant Hybrid
 
Blue Dream - 50:50 Hybrid
 
Dog Walker OG - 80:20 Indica Dominant Hybrid

15729,"Single Source. Local. Independent. Organic.







I started cultivating cannabis over a decade ago in order to provide a close family member with a consistent supply of high quality, pesticide free cannabis flower. I immediately fell in love with the process of cannabis cultivation – starting with a seed or small cutting and nurturing it until it produced mature flowers. I remember it feeling like a magical experience. Over the years, I turned many closets, tents, cupboards, crawlspaces, bedrooms and basements into makeshift grow rooms. 







In 2016, I set out to find a permanent, commercial facility. At the time, there were limited options for commercial cannabis real estate in Ann Arbor. My best option was an abandoned cat shelter on South Maple and Winewood Ave. on the West side of Ann Arbor. Beginning with a thorough cleaning, myself and a handful of friends converted the run-down cat shelter into a start-of-the-art indoor cultivation facility. In 2017, the city gave me a Certificate of Occupancy to cultivate and process 72 cannabis plants. We eventually added a processing lab and retail space to the facility, with the goal of becoming an organic, independent, seed to sale cannabis facility. 







Our goal is to grow and produce the best quality cannabis products possible. Because we are licensed as a “Marijuana Microbusiness”, we only sell cannabis products that were grown and produced on-site. This license restricts our plant count to 150, which means we have the time to ensure every plant gets exactly what it requires. Our on-site cannabis processing lab will only process material from our gardens, which allows us to focus on making the purest, most terpene rich concentrates possible. 







We believe the secret to quality cannabis comes from healthy plants grown as naturally as possible. In our grow rooms, nutrient injected grow cubes are replaced by organic soil and purified water. Chemical pesticides are replaced by a natural, holistic integrated pest management system. An automated irrigation system is replaced by the green thumb of a real person.",,5,ce/cea75278f7b941cd68e6ec303daf261a5b6dff26.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/015/729/avatar/original/1636378384-circular_logo.png,,Winewood Organics,0,0,winewood,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/winewood,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company’s cannabis genetics library is among the most sought after in the world. Built upon decades of cultivation experience and devotion to growing the rarest genetics, Wonderbrett’s global acclaim and cultural relevance is intrinsic to music, art and style through its history cementing the famous OG Kush strain in hit songs during the late '90s. The founders and its team have a deep history of fostering the symbiotic relationship between cannabis as plant medicine, with creatives such as artists, designers and musicians.




Wonderbrett also built one of the largest cultivation facilities in North America. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., the operation features custom-designed irrigation systems that integrate advanced technology with time-honored, traditional cultivation techniques. This ensures craft-style, premium products at scale and the continuous development of elite genetics from Californian legacy cultivators. 




In 2021, Wonderbrett will unveil its North American dispensary flagship on North La Brea Avenue in the iconic Fairfax District of Los Angeles. The store is a result of Wonderbrett founders receiving a social equity retail license in 2018 from L.A. County’s cannabis commission.

9731,"Great extracts, great price, no filler! Woodland Wax Co. exists to provide you with a satisfying, trustworthy experience.

 

WHO 

Back in 2018, Woodland Wax Co. started to notice some sneaky trends in the recreational cannabis scene. Brands were pushing up their prices, without increasing quality. At the same time, cannabis extraction technology and knowledge were advancing fast. The crew at Woodland Wax Co. saw this disconnect and thought: we can do better. After months of R&D, we were able to achieve the quality we demand while becoming efficient enough to consistently be one of the most accessible options California has to offer.

 

WHAT 

Woodland Wax Co. proudly offers live and cured resins, THCa isolates (powder, diamonds, etc.), and high-terpene full spectrum extracts (HTFSE, aka terp sauce).

 

WHERE 

Woodland Wax Co. is based in Woodland CA in Yolo County, just outside of Sacramento. We’re proud to be one of the only licensed cannabis extract in all of Yolo County!

 

WHEN 

The vision for Woodland Wax Co. came together in 2018. We had a newly licensed lab at our disposal and decades of combined experience from our team. In 2019 we started dialing in our processes and sourcing high quality biomass (cannabis preserved for extraction). Late 2019 we released our first drop with just 5 products. Now in 2020 there are 30+ products and we’re still charging full speed.

 

WHY 

Let’s face it, dabs can be expensive. This makes it hard for many working Californians to access high quality cannabis extracts. We knew we had an opportunity to fix things, so we did. Woodland Wax Co. has strived to be a good neighbor from the start. We want to make sure our friends, family, and neighbors have access to pure, clean, high-quality cannabis extracts. We saw this opportunity and jumped on it!

 

HOW 

With our decades of combined experience, Woodland Wax Co. got to work on dialing in our processes. We have access to some amazing, fresh frozen cannabis and have worked hard to cultivate strong relationships with the farmers that provide us with biomass for our extracts. Because we’re so familiar with these farms and strains, we’re able to get the max amount of cannabinoids and terpenes in extremely efficient ways.

Eran años de experimentar, de ilusión, de aprender y compartir. Fue mi primer contacto con el cannabis. En 1995 sufro una grave enfermedad y es una de mis doctoras la que me recomienda el uso de la marihuana como medicina. Gracias a ella, SIEMPRE TE RECORDARE Sefa, ese es el inicio de más de 20 años de auto cultivo. Más tarde se realizaron las primeras selecciones y cruces experimentales para mi propio uso y finalmente nace Xtreme Seeds en el año 2009 presentándose en sociedad en 2012 y en Grow Med Valencia 2013. Desde entonces y hasta ahora, el camino a sido duro y complicado, pero la ilusión y el amor por esta increíble planta nos da fuerza para seguir adelante por muchas piedras que encontremos en en camino.

1933,"Yeti Farms founder Shawn Honaker has come a long way in life. An Indiana Native raised in a loving but strict home, he learned early the value of hard work. Typical of the farming agricultural community he grew up in, Shawn had his first job at 9 years old.
 
As Shawn came of age he had many jobs and businesses ranging from car maintenance to lawn care, later commenting this experience was priceless in cementing his focus on self-sufficiency. Once at college with his entrepreneurial experience and drive he focused on Business Finance as his major. A year away from graduating with a Degree in Business Finance he dropped out to start his career in Finance.
After a few years working in corporate finance sales, Shawn had saved enough money to start his first business. With some strategic purchases and moves Shawn developed commercial property in Rifle, Colorado and built up a thriving trucking business by his late twenties.
 
Living in Colorado since he was 20, Shawn experienced the Colorado lifestyle and jumped in full-heartedly, operating a small hobby ranch in Rifle while running his businesses. Shawn then watched the legalization of marijuana, both medical and recreational, and realized he was the perfect person to work in the industry.
 
Shawn then started the long process of building Yeti Farms. Over the next few years Shawn perfected his grow skills, specializing in soil grows using Colorado’s natural sunlight.
 
The Pueblo-based Yeti Farms is an anomaly in the marijuana business as it grows outdoors in the sun. In an industry where much of the product is gown in hi-tech, indoor, artificial lighting, Shawn went back to his agricultural roots and started farming again. All of Yeti Farms’ marijuana is grown outdoors in Shawn’s proprietary soil and under the natural sun.
 
Today with his wealth of cultivation knowledge and experience, he has focused on extracting from Yeti Farms Cannabis the finest Budder, Shatter and Wax. The cornerstone of Yeti farms is his high-quality product “Blonde Sugar”. With a planned 2016 launch of his new private label product “Blonde Sugar”, Yeti Farms will raise the bar on quality and consistency in the extraction marketplace.",,109,27/27d9c8c9ffa6d102a068fd318f8362faf33ab093.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/933/avatar/original/yeti-farms_logo-v2.jpg,,Yeti Farms,4.40000009536743,3,yeti-farms,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/yeti-farms,,,,,,,,,,,,

We stock only the best genetics available
All our strains are related to the all time classics such as haze or white species

When you enjoy Zoobees Doobees flowers, prerolls, or concentrates, you are sure to hit the high note.
 
 
 
History
 
Zoobees Doobees is a Washington leader, among the first wave of Washington cannabusinesses post-legalization. The founding members have diverse and eclectic backgrounds that come together in perfect harmony.
 
 
 
One of the co-founder was a newspaper journalist eager to make an impact in the medical cannabis industry. She saw medical cannabis as a powerful tool that has the potential to end the opioid epidemic. As cannabis legalization approached, she connected with a master grower with over 30 years of experience, and together they developed a premier cannabis farm that utilized natural elements to yield clean, organic buds. In 2014, the founding team launched Zoobee Doobees, unveiling a robust selection of connoisseur-grade cannabis products.
 
 
 
Process
 
Zoobees Doobees cannabis gardens are outfitted to maintain their strain’s environmental preferences. They cultivate their flowers in outdoor, indoor, and greenhouse environments, depending on the needs of the cultivar phenotype. Zoobees Doobees’ farm is organic from top to bottom. The master grower plants their buds in living soil and uses natural solutions like essential oils for pest control.
 
 
 
Products
 
For exotic flowers cultivated by an experienced and dedicated master grower, look to Zoobees Doobees. Their Orange Dream flower is a Sativa strain created from crossing Orange Crush x Blue Dream — a Zoobees Doobees exclusive. Zoobees Doobees’ strain selection includes a mixture of classic favorites like Grand Daddy Purple and rare cultivars like Texas Timewarp and Sour Chiesel. A Pack of Zoobees serves-up 10 prerolls, each filled with a mid-potency blend of flowers that could easily pass for cigarettes. Hash Pucks are Zoobees Doobees’ ice hash concentrate, and makes the perfect potent addition to a fresh bowl of flowers or can even be enjoyed alone.

At Zoots, we like to focus on the little things. Like handcrafted small batch treats made with premium infused cannabis paired with unique blends tailored to your interests, desires and intentions. Best of all, our nibbles and drinks taste delicious, too. The days of dividing brownies and crumbling cookies is a thing of the past. Zoots by the serving is here to stay. Are you feeling empowered?
 
Welcome to Zootology. A study in fine, artisan crafted cannabis nibbles and drinks.
 
Our Zootologists carefully extract the essential oils of the marijuana plant in a contaminant-free environment using our proprietary Cypress Extraction Method™. This closed-loop process captures the THC using organic cane alcohol in a cold fusion process. So, you can be assured that each serving is consistent. And while everyone experiences cannabis individually, Zoots is about having a good time without feeling uncomfortably stoned. Which is what sets Zoots apart as a purveyor of fine cannabis edibles.

An enhanced pre-roll experience.
 
Fatty’s offers California patients and residents the most superior cannabis products imaginable. By providing a wide selection of strains to fit any cannabis consumer’s palate, Fatty’s prioritizes quality using only high grade material to offer a conveniently cool smoking experience consistently. They continually innovate and improve, and every day Fatty’s works to bring fine pre-roll products to the marijuana market.
 
History:
 
Fatty’s got their start in 2016, throwing themselves into creating the best pre-rolls on the market. The founder of Fatty’s passed ten years in the grower industry, cultivating unique and potent flower for extractors and other industry members before noticing a trend. Smoking marijuana often took time, and while pre-rolls were prevalent patients either had to painstakingly roll a joint themselves or purchase one, often of lower quality or potency. He knew he could do better, and in 2016 he assembled a team of like minded individuals to redefine pre-rolls, layering them with a new layer of fresh and unique style geared for the cannabis connoisseur. Growing through months of trial and error, Fatty’s perfected their methods and personal style to offer a selection of potent, sleek, and pleasurable pre-rolls ideal for the hippest smoker.
 
Process:
 
Following careful experimentation, Fatty’s developed their proprietary method of decarboxylation and curing to fill in the perfect pre-roll. Growing their marijuana flowers in-house utilizing decades of cultivation history, Fatty’s can offer a potent, powerful cannabis experience with one puff. For their Rosin Rolls, they naturally extract their materials from their Rosin press processes. Following extraction, Fatty’s infuses each material with solvent-free Rosin Wax, Hash, and then roll in Kief all from the same strain. With all this combined, this pre-roll packs a powerful punch.
 
Products:
 
Fatty’s proudly offers their pre-rolls, Rosin rolls and Oil Sticks vape pens in a variety of strain-specific flavors, perfect for any smoking situation. They offer old favorites like Gorilla Glue, Fire OG, and Platinum Cookies as well as their unique, in-house creations Black Diamond Sherbet, Chocolope Chip Cookies, Orange Guava, and dozens more. Fatty’s pre-rolls elevate the on-the-go cannabis smoking experience like no other.
 
Lab Testing:
 
The Fatty’s team meticulously lab tests their products at SC Labs, so their clients can rest assured they’re smoking the purest, most potent products available. Fatty’s tests for solvent purity, residual materials and cannabinoid potency with each batch.
 
Networks:
 
Marijuana enthusiasts can find Fatty’s products in dispensaries across California, including the notable Zen Healing in West Hollywood.

History
 
The Fire Stix founder has a longstanding relationship with medical cannabis and decades of experience with the cultivation of the plant. He became enamored with marijuana when he saw the positive impact it had on his loved ones suffering from various ailments. As he learned more about cannabis, his love for marijuana grew deeper, and he got into growing. “My first run was A-1!” the founder explained when reminiscing his first crop of flowers. It seemed him and Mary Jane were meant to be and as the cannabis industry evolved, he evolved with it. As the marijuana industry moved into a fascination with concentrates, the founder was right there with it. He began perfecting the methods as they emerged until he developed cannabis extractions he felt worthy to debut. The result of that journey is Fire Stix, a boutique cannabis extraction company devoted to creating concentrates that exude excellence in every puff.

3788,"In our 16,000 sq. ft. facility we have 8 separate 24 light flower rooms, enabling our master growers to give hands on attention to every plant. Our perpetual harvest means that we’ll be taking down a room weekly for the rest of our lives! The most important factor to a successful grow operation is the ability to control the environment. Because of this, we designed our facility around a Closed Grow Environment(CGE) ideology. This allows us to control temperature, humidity, CO2 and optimal light distribution throughout each room. Our goal, was to design a facility that could replicate the quality of a professional 8-light grow, but doing so on a grander scale.

freya CBDCURE bietet legale CBD Produkte an die Ihnen die ganze Bandbreite der positiven Effekte der Cannabis-Pflanze dienlich macht.

freya CBDCURE Blüten sind legal, weisen einen THC-Gehalt von unter 0,2% auf, werden in der Schweiz angebaut und aus Nutzhanf aus dem EU Sortenkatalog gewonnen. 
 
Entstanden ist die Idee zur Gründung von freya CBDCURE aus persönlichen Gründen: Andreina Fernandez De Schafferer, gebürtige Venezolanerin, hatte in Ihrer Wahlheimat sowohl mit zahlreichen Herausforderungen als auch mit den Folgen Ihrer sportlichen Tätigkeit zu kämpfen. „Chronische Rückenschmerzen, der stressige Alltag und das Klima in Österreich machten wir zu schaffen. Die Rückenschmerzen wurden chronisch, die Belastung zuviel – der Verlust des Arbeitsplatzes war die Folge. Ein Tipp von Verwandten aus den USA brachte mir die Lösung meiner Probleme: CBD half mir, mich geistig und körperlich zu entspannen – die Rückenschmerzen sind weg, ich schlafe gut und fühle mich rundum wohl und entspannt. Es geht mir so gut, dass ich beschlossen habe mit CBD-Produkten meinen eigenen Arbeitsplatz zu schaffen und anderen Menschen an den positiven Kräften dieses Jahrhunderte-alten „Wunderkrauts“ teilhaben zu lassen“.
 
Andreinas Beschäftigung mit der Geschichte von Hanf mit jahrtausendelanger Tradition in der ganzen Welt führte schließlich zum Namen: Freya, bei den alten Germanen als Göttin der Fruchtbarkeit und des Frühlings, des Glücks und der Liebe, sowie als Lehrerin des Zaubers verehrt
 
„Ich war überrascht, dass Hanf auch hier in Europa solch eine Geschichte hat – freya CBDCURE möchte an diese Tradition anknüpfen und den Menschen bei der Bewältigung der Herausforderungen im 21. Jahrhundert helfen“ so Andreina.
 
Unser Hanf wird auf einem staatlich lizenzierten Bauernhof in der Schweiz biologisch angebaut, wo er auf Reinheit getestet wird. Der Hanf wird dann in derselben staatlich lizenzierten Einrichtung extrahiert, wo die CBD erneut getestet wird. Ein weiterer Test erfolgt nach dem Versand in Österreich, um den CBD und den THC Gehalt zu überprüfen.",https://www.facebook.com/freyacbdcure/,3,22/22d9a2c59d6f2d961120a4e88bcf4d9a01c4f5a9.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/007/300/avatar/original/1559897623-LOGO_freya_Trans.png,https://www.instagram.com/freya_cbd_cure/,freya CBDCURE,1,1,freya-cbdcure,https://twitter.com/freya_cbd_cure,https://weedmaps.com/brands/freya-cbdcure,www.freya-cbdcure.com,,,,,,,,,,,

Frostbite Farms is Michigan’s source of premium quality, organic medical cannabis flowers. Few in the state can produce flowers the way Frostbite Farms does, and with a focus on quality over yield, patients always receive the best of the best. Each team member has an individual passion for medical cannabis and believes Michigan patients have a right to holistic medicine. Frostbite Farms’ mission is to connect patients in need of all-natural, organic medication to the most effective conduit of relief: cannabis.
 
 
 
History
 
Frostbite Farms was born from the snowball effect. In 2014, the founder began a small cultivation in his home. During this time, he dove head-first into research and development to perfect his craft. He was able to fine-tune his cultivation methods to the needs of the strain and discern what elements produce what reactions. As his skill continued to build, he expanded to larger and larger operations, eventually moving his grow into its own building.
 
 
 
The founder wanted to take the Michigan cannabis industry to the next level and put a name and background to the flowers that appeared in dispensaries. His mission was to take the medical cannabis market out of just trying to “fill slots,” and push the towards making accurate strain information available to the patients.
 
 
 
Once the founder discovered his soil regime and perfected his process, cultivation stopped feeling like work and spending time with the plants always felt extremely rewarding. On November 2017, he was ready to put a name to his buds and launched Frostbite Farms, showcasing a new approach to medical cannabis.
 
 
 
Process
 
Professionalism is vital to Frostbite Farms, and their team has mastered the balance between being polished and down to earth. Frostbite Farms master grower marinades his soil for up to three months before planting his crop. All nutrients are organic and cultivated with such purity they never need to be flushed. Once ready for harvest, the master grower carefully harvests and cures the buds to perfection. The resulting strains display the signature of Frostbite Farms’ perfected regime. Frostbite Farms flowers exhibit alluring bud appeal and provide an even better smoking experience.
 
 
 
Products
 
Once you toke on Frostbite Farms flowers, you’ll see why the Frostbite Farms team takes pride in their yield. Patients cannot keep their hands off of their Platinum Cookies flowers, and with THC content as high as 29% it’s no mystery as to why. These ladies possess incredible bud-appeal and a terpene profile that directly reflects its Girl Scout Cookies lineage. No matter which premium flowers you choose, if it's from Frostbite Farms, you know quality is guaranteed.

- Ganja Gold team

 

The sole purpose of merely “getting people high” misses the mark. With Ganja Gold, patrons get a robust cannabis experience unlike any other. Every product is designed to enhance and completely innovate what you’ve come to expect from flower and extractions.

 

Ganja Gold’s team of long-standing industry experts never lost sight of the medical aspect of cannabis. Those early champions who pushed for safe access to all-natural medicine are never forgotten. The Ganja Gold team believes it is their duty to produce the finest and most reliable cannabis products to build upon the efforts of those before them. Ganja Gold is paving the way for a brighter representation of the cannabis community while developing the most inspiring cannabis products.

 

History

Alex Patel is a cannabis innovator who has been making waves in the industry since 2008. When he and his team set out to create Ganja Gold it was to bring a focus on quality broadly neglected by many producers.

 

In 2012 Ganja Gold burst onto the scene with Tarantula Pre Rolls, a strain-specific concoction of premium flowers, kief, and 90%+ THC oil. The flagship item sailed far, and with it, the expectations of a preroll were heightened. Ganja Gold has continued to develop a catalog of incredible high-end items. Today, their team is focused on creating breakthrough cannabis technology with exciting products that will change the way patients medicate.

 

Process

Quality begins on the farm, and Ganja Gold is proud to work with a network of organic, Clean Green Certified cannabis gardens. There, dedicated master growers cultivate a premium selection of bud to reach their optimal genetic potential. When ready, those flowers are harvested, cured to perfection, then sent to the Ganja Gold state-of-the-art facility for processing. There, Ganja Gold extraction artists isolate the most desirable characteristics of the strain with various forms of extraction. No matter the method or the product, each is a high-end, luxury item that defies the norm and reshapes the cannabis landscape.

 

Products

Here are just a few of Ganja Gold's premium cannabis options. 

 

Tarantula

Ganja Gold Tarantula Prerolls come in Blue, Green, Red and King varieties, each unparalleled to any other rolled flower. Blue Tarantula features strain-specific flowers cultivated indoors while Green is comprised of sun-grown buds.

 

Seasoned patients or adult users will meet their match with King Tarantula. This preroll packs a whopping two grams of premium flowers and like the others are coated in strain-specific CO2 oil then rolled in kief.

 

Lab Testing

Ganja Gold is proud to offer full panel lab tested products provided by CA licensed labs.",,2953,15/1561a1c96bacffd28e27b71c1f43ec3bc07deba3.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/595/avatar/original/1648974906-gg_transparent__1_.jpg,GanjaGold.Cali,Ganja Gold,4.80198001861572,38,ganja-gold,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/ganja-gold,www.ganjagold.com,,,,,,,,,,,

De esta manera se consigue combinar las exquisitas propiedades organolépticas del mundo vegetal con unos ciertos efectos medicinales comprobados científicamente y la Alta Cocina de Vanguardia, resultando en una experiencia gastronómica hoy por hoy única en el mundo. 
 
Desde Gea Biopharma creemos que es posible disfrutar de la ciencia culinaria y al mismo tiempo ayudar a nuestro cuerpo a mantener su equilibrio mediante el uso de extractos de plantas milenarias y reconocido poder paliativo para ciertas dolencias, sobre todo relacionadas con el dolor, la ansiedad o el insomnio. Por otra parte, la utilización de productos certificados derivados del cáñamo para las elaboraciones de base como biscotes, emulsiones o harinas garantiza unas características alimentarias muy exclusivas, como los altos contenidos en acidos Omega que se encuentran en el aceite obtenido de sus semillas o de su concentración media del 3% de ácido gamma-linoleico (GLA) que lo hace único entre los acites comestibles.
 
Por todo esto, y con el fin de acercar al público en general este nuevo tipo de cocina, Gea Biopharma está presente en la mayoría de Ferias y Eventos relacionados con el cáñamo industrial, presentando talleres de gastronomía medicinal y la realización de menús en directo por parte de nuestro Chef y su posterior degustación, con la explicación de las técnicas empleadas en las elaboraciones así como de las propiedades de las bases terpénicas utilizadas en cada plato y su aplicación terapéutica. En estas demostraciones explicamos “en directo” como funciona todo esto y que el público en general pueda catar algunos de los manjares que prepara Chef Nuro.

Gemstonz offers a line of CBD infused tinctures, edibles, topicals and pet products crafted with the utmost care and quality. Gemstonz is the perfect product for those in need of a smoke-free option. Each product is entirely pure and made with organic ingredients when possible.
 
 
 
Formulated by a cannabis user of 40 years, Gemstonz is where a passion for helping others and enthusiasm for medicinal cannabis collide. With Gemstonz, users are empowered with the benefits of pain-relieving cannabinoids without intoxicating effects. The founder, Marcy, has focused her efforts on Cannabidiol (CBD) based solutions. Her CBD approach opens the door for many people in need of all-natural alternative medicine but don’t want to smoke or experience the traditional high from cannabis. Life is precious, make it marvelous with Gemstonz.
 
 
 
History
 
Lasting Healing
 
Marcy is a long-time cannabis advocate and became acquainted with the plant's use in the ‘70s. As an athlete in her youth, Marcy has undergone several surgeries from sports injuries. Each time she’s turned to cannabis for relief, not giving her prescribed pharmaceuticals the time of day. Ten years passed and Marcy discovered a tumor in her foot. Lucky it was non-cancerous, which she attributes to her cannabis use, but it left severe bone damage. The surgeries that followed resulted in daily neuropathological problems, and a new class of prescriptions came her way. While treating the pain, neuropathy, and muscle spasms, Marcy experienced side effects she described as rendering her “sick, fat, or crazy,” which she would have tolerated had the medications actually worked.
 
 
 
Marcy was not the only one in need of a better alternative. Her daughter suffers from eczema and dry skin, and after trying every steroid cream available over the counter and even trying some to prescription-strength creams, Marcy's daughter still did not gain any relief. Marcy had to find something that would help. She no longer wanted to give her child steroids and made it her purpose to find a solution to both of their conditions.
 
 
 
A Purposeful Accident
 
When managing the pain and spasms from her foot injury, Marcy gained the most relief from cannabis. One day Marcy was visiting a local cannabis dispensary with a friend. Marcy’s friend loved medicated hard candies, but the ones available were not very good. Her friend encouraged Marcy to make some, citing her savvy kitchen skills. That encouragement sparked Marcy to research her options, and she dove deep into understand how cannabinoids work with the body. She developed a formulation for medicated hard candy and got special molds shaped like gems that fit comfortably in the mouth, earning the name Gemstonz. Her candies took off, and she expanded into tinctures and balms, eventually adding pet products to the catalog. Today, Gemstonz continues to supply California a high-quality, all-natural solution to pain.
 
 
 
Process
 
Marcy starts with the purest activated CBD extract then infuses it into a proprietary blend for each of her products. She sources her cannabis oils from a trusted facility that uses the best practices available to extract their oils from clean and potent hemp flowers.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
Each Gemstonz product is full-spectrum lab tested multiple times, beginning with the flowers followed by testing the extract, then screening the final product through SC Labs.",,196,27/27c524b92f71e7e3a4a2853172d3ef1a13f48d94.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/934/avatar/original/1564779736-fullsizeoutput_d73.jpeg,,Gemstonz,5,17,gemstonz,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/gemstonz,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leader of the American Cannabis Revolution
 
 
 
G FarmaLabs has become a well known brand throughout the cannabis community with both cannabis patients and connoisseurs alike. G FarmaLabs is committed to applying science and global resources to design and develop market leading brands in the cannabis flower, extracts, and edible product areas.
 
History:
 
Family owned and operated, G Farmalabs was conceived in 2007 by husband and wife team Ata and Nicole Gonzalez. Forced to relocate to California in 2009 after the financial crisis known as “The Great Recession,” Ata and Nicole believed the end of marijuana prohibition was near. Upon arriving in California, Ata attended Oaksterdam University and rented their first farm in Northern California. Together they carefully planted and harvested their first batch of marijuana flowers. Nicole is a member of a fourth generation tobacco family and has a strong background in the cigar industry. In 2013, G FarmaLabs launched America’s first complete brand of cannabis products.
 
In 2015, Ata and Nicole’s idea had now become reality. G FarmaBrands was born. G FarmaLabs is the world’s first cannabis company that dedicates their effort to following the traditional lessons adapted from the Tobacco Industry. G FarmaLabs infused the two commercial enterprises to create a variety of products in an emerging market, setting the trend for the future of cannabis by merging the two industries.
 
Process:
 
G FarmaLabs works closely with a team of professionals who designed the California based processing center and production facility called the “Innovation Center” located in Desert Hot Springs, California. They have adopted the phrase “Napa Valley of Cannabis” and focus on blending the finest Domestic Cultivated Cannabis. Consistently cultivated, G FarmaLabs uses the same secret strains, each carefully chosen to guarantee a consistent experience.
 
Perfecting the recipe and process, the G FarmaLabs farmers cultivate, harvest, dry, and trim their seven strains making it possible for customers to experience the aroma and feel the passion and precision the team at G FarmaLabs dedicates to their line of products.
 
Products:
 
Offering a variety of products from pre-rolls to edibles, G FarmaLabs caters to a wide market of cannabis users. G Stiks, their line of prestigious, 100% indoor grown pre-rolled joints are grown, processed, and rolled by G FarmaLabs and are available in 6 different options depending on user preference. For people who prefer Indica, G FarmaLabs G Stiks offers “ROJO”, packaged in red symbolizing a potent form of medicine. Patients in medical marijuana states enjoy the highly desired “VIOLETA” G Stik, packaged in purple, similar to violet, symbolizing various things from royalty to wealth, magic and mystery. The “AMARILLO” Sativa G Stiks symbolize a yellow butterfly purposely chosen to create a euphoric feeling for patients who suffer from depression. The “ROSADO” Sativa G Stik symbolizing one of the most celebrated flowers, the Pink Lotus Flower and is designed to uplift the heart and mind. The “VERDE” G Stik symbolizes energy and healing and the “NARAN-JA” G Stik symbolizes the Orange Rose. G FarmaLabs’ hybrid G Stiks offer a solution for connoisseurs on the go who need a product that is ready to go. The “VERDE” blend promotes energy healing and stress relief.
 
In addition to G Stiks, G FarmaLabs also offers a line of vapor products, injectors, and edibles.

Ghost Labs cares about two things in this world: cannabis and their customers. They cultivate curated selections of organic, high-quality marijuana flower to offer their patrons a cannabis experience several cuts above the rest. Dedicated to the health-conscious consumer, Ghost Labs promises a cleaner, smoother flower free from anything harmful. Every time a patient chooses Ghost Labs’ flower, they choose excellence.
 
 
 
History:
 
After working in the marijuana industry since before the new millennium, Ghost Labs began cultivating in late 2004. The company’s founder started his cultivation career working in a Pre-ICO dispensary in the San Fernando Valley, making new connections and eventually learning how to cultivate the highest-quality cannabis under the sun. He realized how many farmers were taking advantage of patients by giving them pesticide-soaked or poorly cured cannabis, and vowed only to grow organic, clean, high-quality marijuana.Ghost Labs sprouted their first crops while slowly growing their team until they assembled a partnership of individuals passionate about the cannabis plant. The Ghost Labs team grew into a large greenhouse operation with several indoor crops all flowering to their best potential. As they continue to grow, Ghost Labs is dedicated to the high level of quality, care, and compassion they offer patients with every crop.
 
 
 
Products:
 
The growers of Ghost Labs often can be found talking to their cannabis plants, where the check and handle each row daily. This high level of care trickles through their 100% organic processes - all soil, insecticides, nutrients, and water are entirely chemical-free. Ghost Labs growers cultivate genetics sourced from well-established breeders, and they’re always on the lookout for cutting-edge strains with powerful medicinal benefits. Gorilla Glue #4 from their greenhouse is their most demanded strain, while their rotation of OGs and exotic genetics also receive high praise.
 
 
 
Lab Testing:
 
Ghost Labs is committed to clean, efficient cannabis in every batch. As such, they test with SC Labs to ascertain both their flower’s potency and cleanliness from pesticides in each crop.",,70,59/59b4cd2f95f4456ecc30b9ca9d554ba968533aad.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/522/avatar/original/ghost_labs_200x200.jpg,,Ghost Labs,5,0,ghost-labs,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/ghost-labs,,,,,,,,,,,,

With help from the elements, and through evolution, Mother Earth created plants aeons before bothering with us. As with all animal populations on earth, we are here to survive and procreate, but we all have a subliminal analogous purpose to transport, disperse and preserve seeds and plants to ensure genetic survival for the future. All plants are miracles, especially cannabis, and there are many overlooked and suppressed benefits to be unearthed / realised in the near future. 
 
Team Krippling are blissful servants to this plant with breeding/proofing stations in a few countries throughout Europe*, working on hundreds of different strains from all over the world. Many of Team Krippling's breeders have techniques and knowledge from generations of farming, and as much as we share genetics, techniques and co-operate with other seedbanks and breeders, we are committed to seeking our own champion ""Hercules"" ganja mother and father strains, by popping hundreds of pips weekly, if not every other day, from select original breeders / seedbanks, as well as being on the lookout for a super performer from brand new strains and seedbanks.
 
These monstrous genetics are a result of Team Krippling's passion and commitment to these plants, combined with various growing/breeding techniques, from up to date hydroponics ( some even CO2 and magnetically charged ) breeding/proofing stations, to good old fashioned soil and plain water. You name the technique or growing medium and one of our breeders is using it. You name the nutrient and one of our breeders is more than likely using / testing(ed) it. Each breeder works with what they know best, and no toxic chemicals are used on any of the plants used to produce the actual seeds ( male or female ), further ensuring we only bring out powerful strains that are stable, and suitable for all grow techniques. A key ingredient in producing our exSEEDingly potent strains is loving care and devotion to the science. Dr Krippling is very proud to introduce these crazy new genetics, which produce outrageous yields, smells, tastes and effects.
 
The main genetic make up of each strain is provided, although some of the genetics, which give our strains the stability and Krippling effects we were after, will remain secret with us.
 
Team Krippling is constantly fine tuning and seeking super strong genetics to present high quality strains for the planet. After much more research, time and energy has been lovingly and happily spent by all at Team Krippling, our catalogoue should only get bigger and better.......

1854,"OUR MISSION – LAWS WE LIVE BY
 
1. “Know Your Dose”.
 
We want to change the perception of edibles in the cannabis space by promoting our mantra, “Know Your Dose”! Our commitment to delivering delectable, bite-sized, reliable and consistently dosed products allows our patients to learn what dosage is perfect for them - insuring an optimal experience with our products every time. Education is key.
 
2. “Taste the Cookie, not the Cannabis”!
 
We strive to make products with as little weed taste as possible.This can only be achieved by using the purest and finest distilled THC extract. This costs us more, but because our mission is to make only delicious products, we feel that it is more than worth the expense.
 
We honor the legacy of our dad, the original Dr. Norm by caring about the well-being of our patients.
 
We imbue his healing powers, personable and caring ways and great sense of humor in all that we do. As Dr. Norm did, we treat people like family!
 
HISTORY
 
Dr. Norm’s was founded by the brother sister team of Jeff Koz and Roberta Wilson. We started the company in honor of our dad, Dr. Norm Koz. He was a beloved MD who gave very personalized “old school” care to his patients, whom he treated like family. His deep sense of caring about his patients’ well being is what inspired us to do the very same with the Dr. Norm’s Brand.
 
The idea for Dr. Norm’s came from our experience in the traditional cookie industry. We started a company 5 years ago in honor of our beloved Mom! A pharmacist by profession, but a baker by passion, she spread her love through her cookies and felt they were the best “prescription” for all that ails. In fact, our initial flavor “Chocolate Chip Therapy” is based on our mom’s actual recipe! Our line of cookies is sold at Whole Foods, Sprouts, Stater Brothers, Gelson’s and now Costco! We have the knowledge and experience of how to manufacture to scale and provide a top quality product to the traditional grocery industry.
 
With the growing popularity of medical cannabis products, we saw an opportunity to launch a brand that could potentially change the reputation of edibles in this space.
 
Most of us have a personal story or know of someone who has overdosed on cannabis products! Edibles get a bad rap due to the fact that people are not properly dosing and often ingest too much THC to have an enjoyable experience. We wanted to take the success we’ve had with our traditional cookie brand and bring it to the edibles market - but do it in a way that delivers a safe, delicious, and reliable experience every time. To that end, we decided to create “minis” that contained a perfectly measured dose in each bite-sized cookie. In fact, we coined the phrase, “Know Your Dose”™ which we put on our packaging and utilize in all of our marketing materials. In addition to providing delicious products, we feel it’s crucial to educate our patients on the importance of finding their perfect dose. This will insure that they have a positive experience with our products every time.
 
As we began our product development, we realized something rather startling about this industry. Most every edible product had a noticeable weed taste – some to a scary degree! This realization led us to a concept that distinguishes our brand. We strive to make products with as little cannabis taste as possible! We achieve this through the use of our proprietary, award winning THC extract. We infuse our cookies with a “clear”, distilled oil with a 91% potency (the same stuff used for shatter and higher quality vape cartridges). This superior extract has enabled us to make a delicious product with very little cannabis taste. We like to say, “Taste the Cookie, not the Cannabis!”",,1639,97/97655ef14869ebbdfe987a385c07f602195420df.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/854/avatar/original/1641588234-dr-norms_weedmaps-logo1.jpg,,Dr. Norm's,4.89385461807251,104,dr-norms,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/dr-norms,,,,,,,,,,,,

853,"Dutch Passion are one of the world’s oldest cannabis seedbanks and one of the few remaining original seed companies. We offer our customers a variety of original classic marijuana varieties as well as some of the very best new varieties, many of these are available in regular as well as feminized seeds. We began our work in the 1970’s and were formally established as a seedbank in 1987.

Our success has been built on 3 important principles. 

Firstly we collect and breed the best cannabis genetics to allow the self-sufficient cannabis grower the chance to grow the very best quality marijuana for themselves. 

Secondly, we continue to pioneer innovation. We invented feminized seed in the 1990’s and more recently we have set the highest standards with feminized autoflowering (‘AutoFem’) seeds. Dutch Passion has never been afraid to overturn conventional thinking in order to offer better seeds.

Thirdly, we offer our customers the best levels of customer service. We have remained in business over several decades by providing seeds of the highest quality and reliability and have millions of satisfied customers. If for any reason at all you are not satisfied with our seeds then contact us and we will make things right.

Our seed collection has never been stronger than it is today. We remain the first choice seed supplier to many recreational and medical marijuana growers because of our focus on quality seeds and our safe trustworthy customer service.




 Dutch Passion Values.

Ever since the beginning we have realised that great customer service is nothing without the best quality seeds. Our many years in business has allowed us to build an unrivalled network of the best cannabis breeders and marijuana professionals. Every one of our varieties is carefully selected and produced to the highest possible standards. Many of our varieties have won numerous prizes and are regarded as some of the best varieties ever created. Strains such as our original White Widow, Blueberry, Skunk #11, Power Plant and Mazar have become famous varieties and household names. Many of the new seedbanks base their own varieties on Dutch Passion original genetics. 

Our legendary varieties are still as popular now as they were in the 1980’s and 1990’s, many of them are available in regular seeds as well as feminized. Everything we do is focussed on providing our customers with consistent and high-performance cannabis seeds, and we stock around 50 different varieties.

If we find a top quality new variety we will introduce this into our collection, sometimes at the expense of a less popular existing variety. This way we maintain a competitive selection of top performing best selling genetics. Any new variety has to be really good to make it into our catalogue, and such is our confidence in our new varieties that they are grown in live internet grow diaries by customers before they go on public sale. Very few seedbanks offer this level of openness towards their new varieties, we hope it demonstrates the belief we have in our ability to deliver the very best genetics, the finest quality and the most consistent seed performance levels available.",,386,e0/e0f1dc3005d4b7021108e9d4d25417347dcb4190.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/853/avatar/original/1502915371-dutch-passion-seed.jpg,,Dutch Passion Seed Company,4.75,1,dutch-passion-seed-company,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/dutch-passion-seed-company,,,,,,,,,,,,
6059,"A PROMISE TO YOU 
 
Keeping our word is crucial. What can we say—flakiness just isn’t in our DNA. That’s why when we promise you a consistently clean, high quality product, we mean it. And that unwavering guarantee comes from a genuine respect for the process and hyper-focused attention to the details.
 
At Dutch Valley Farms, we’re not just concerned with high THC levels. We’re focused on the complete synergy of all the compounds, terpenes and cannabinoids that make up the plant. That means you can count on an unparalleled cannabis experience. And you can take that to the bank, er… dispensary.
 
OUR MISSION
 
Situated on seven acres of Oregon wilderness with breathtaking views of Mt. Hood, Dutch Valley Farms strives to produce craft cannabis using socially and environmentally responsible methods that honor the plant’s age-old tradition while recognizing its vast potential.
 
It’s from this pristine expanse of land that we strive to cultivate our cannabis with integrity, respect and a dedication to the purity of the plant.
 
OUR GROW
 
Factory-farmed cannabis. That sounds… questionable (among other things). But as the industry expands, manufacturers are taking short cuts with the grow to help pad their bottom line.
 
Dutch Valley Farms isn’t down with that.
 
Whether it’s beer, wine or handmade furniture, Oregon has a long-standing tradition of honoring the craft behind the product. We’ve embraced that ethos with a commitment to growing craft cannabis using socially and environmentally responsible methods that respect the traditions of the land.
 
What does that mean, exactly?
 
We use natural products and sustainable farming practices to ensure our flower is free of toxins or chemicals for both the consumer and the environment.
 
We respect the environment by using OMRI listed fertilizers. We’ve also implemented an integrated pest management system along with beneficial fungus, microbes and natural predatory insects to deal with potential pests.
 
We capture all storm water runoff from the facility along with A/C and dehumidifier water. In fact, the capture is large enough to water the entire facility, bypassing the need to pull from the local watershed. We also capture our nutrient waste water and use it to fertilize our vegetable garden.
 
We give back by helping further research into cannabis as a viable medical alternative.
 
Does all of this make the process more challenging and time-consuming? Sure. But you can’t rush a good thing, and the proof is in the plant.
 
You’ll see.
 
OUR WHY
 
“Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around.” – Henry David Thoreau
 
All of us have a why. A deeply meaningful reason we do what we do. It gets us up in the morning. It fuels our passion. It motivates us to think smarter, push harder and persevere when the deck seems stacked against us.
 
At Dutch Valley Farms, our why speaks to the heart of who we are. And bringing our customers an unparalleled craft cannabis experience is only part of that story. Here’s the rest of that powerful narrative, straight from our leadership:
 
“What prompted me to stop daydreaming and start Dutch Valley Farms was my mother’s cancer diagnosis. Watching her go through such pain and suffering made me want to help her and provide her with some relief. On April 20, 2016, I quit my job with a large biotech company and formed Dutch Valley Farms to follow my dream of having a grow operation and helping my mom and others like her with the healing properties of cannabis. My mom may have lost her arduous battle with cancer, but her Dutch heritage and need to help others lives on at Dutch Valley Farms."" Matthew O. Brecht, Ph.D., Sales Manager and Founder of Dutch Valley Farms
 
“In 2010, my family’s world was turned upside down. After many months of research and countless sleepless nights, the neurologist uttered the words we had been dreading: ‘Your son is on the autism spectrum.’ Autism. It’s such a scary word for parents who are unaware of what that diagnosis means. After many years of tireless research, we have realized that our son will have a future—a great one. But it means therapy, hard work and an enormous amount of patience will be the norm for the rest of our lives.
 

 
We began researching different tools that might be able to help us, and one of the things we found promise in was cannabis. At first, we didn’t understand the connection. But after many hours spent exploring the benefits of this wonderful plant, we’ve concluded (as many parents with children of disabilities can attest to) that more research HAS to be done to examine the full extent to which it can assist with different ailments and disabilities. This is the reason why we invested in Dutch Valley Farms and why I continue to devote countless hours to this cause.”Anthony J.

872,"OUR MISSION Develop and preserve sustainable sun grown farming methods to produce the highest quality organic CBD cannabis with a resolute commitment to environmental and social responsibility.
 
WE BELIEVE At East Fork, we are more than growers; we are cultivators. We look beyond our plants and work to create a brand that expounds on ideas and cultivates an educated community.
 
We are devoted to the development and preservation of sun grown cannabis and believe that sustainable farming methods produce superior holistic medicine. Our desire to provide Oregonians with a superior plant-based medicine drives our selection of cultivars, or cannabis strains, that are high in CBD.
 
It’s our belief that CDB cultivars have the power to heal and bring relief to those in need. Rooted in a commitment to the environmental and social responsibility we take great pride in the processes and practices implemented on our farm.
 
OUR GROW PHILOSOPHY The small town of Takilma is located in Southern Oregon, between the pristine waters of the East Fork of the Illinois River and the Siskiyou Wilderness—the heart of the world’s best outdoor cannabis growth environment.
 
Here, on a small family farm, is where all our cannabis is organically grown. As an OLCC-licensed and Clean Green Certified farm, we create a balanced and healthy ecosystem by caring for the soil, the water, the air, and we introduce plant partners for optimal symbiosis. We strive to have a positive impact on the environment in which we live and grow, the people in our community, and the people who rely on our products.
 
ORIGIN STORY Starting out, we (Nathan and Aaron Howard) had one goal in mind: grow a superior plant medicine to help relieve our oldest brother and his range of medical conditions. It was witnessing the positive effects of high-CBD cultivars that drove our desire to expand so that we could provide all Oregonians with the same superior medicine—and in turn to purchase East Fork Ranch. Our commitment to both community and high-CBD cultivars has given us a sense of place and pride.
 
WHY CBD From the first-hand experience to recent findings in the medical field, CBD has proven itself a safe, natural and truly effective remedy for ailments of the body. Understanding how CBD affects the brain and body will not only better your understanding of your experience, but will help you educate others.
 
TERROIR A term typically associated with the wine industry, terroir refers to the place-based environmental factors—such as soil, water, and climate—that combine to give distinct characteristics. It’s terroir that enables identical cannabis cultivars to be grown in different regions and produce distinct smell, taste, and effects. Oregon’s Illinois Valley, coupled with our sustainable farming practices and meticulous drying and curing methods, give our cultivars their unique and unparalleled qualities.",,534,05/0529a4fd73930ad4b4136548aeb16e0ee42e97f2.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/872/avatar/original/east-fork-logo_v2.jpg,,East Fork Cultivars,5,9,east-fork-cultivars,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/east-fork-cultivars,,,,,,,,,,,,

History
 
On November of 2016, Brian officially became a ganjapreneur with the launch of his innovative brand, Easy Vape. He formed Easy Vape out of frustration with the cartridges currently on the market. He had been a 420 enthusiast his entire life but had never embarked on selling cannabis in any way. He turned to his father, who has many years of experience in cultivation, to get the best starting material. The tricky part for Brian was getting the distillate just right, and he threw himself into learning how to operate extraction equipment. Once comfortable with the reigns of cannabis extraction, he began to enhance and refine until he produced a distillate he felt proud to debut. Now, Easy Vape is pleased to deliver the finest-quality cannabis distillate in a giant vape cartridge that will outlast the competition.
 
 
 
Process
 
Easy Vape sources their flowers from an indoor cannabis farm based in Los Angeles, California. All of their flowers come from an in-house organic, pesticide-free, hydroponic grow to ensure the utmost quality control from soil to oil. From there, those premium flowers undergo a closed-loop distillation process to create potent cannabis oil. Then, Easy Vape extraction artists reintroduce terpenes from the original strain to express the true essence of the plant. The result is cannabis distillates that provide a full-bodied flavor profile and profound effects.
 
 
 
Products
 
Easy Vape’s jumbo sized, premium cannabis vape cartridges are available in four distilled strain options: Girl Scout Cookies, Purple Killer, Blue Dream, and Purple Widow.
 
GSC is a favorite strain among patients for its minty, nutty, and sweet flavor profile as well as its wonderfully uplifting effects. Easy Vape is pleased to offer their Girl Scout Cookies vape cartridge, packing rich flavor in every inhale. Their Purple Killer cartridge packs 3.2grams of vapor euphoria and has a pungent, grape and floral flavor profile and aroma. With their Blue Dream cannabis vape cartridge, patients never have to leave cloud nine. Experience the incredible blueberry and vanilla flavor of Blue Dream while the soothing, cerebral effects begin to set in. As for their Purple Widow, expect a woody flavor profile with notes of sweet berries and effects that leave patients in a happy and sleepy state. No matter what strain you choose, Easy Vape delivers a stellar smoke experience that lasts and lasts.

History:
 
Erin’s story began in December of 2015 when she underwent back surgery. By March of 2016, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome, and Erin was prescribed the standard Norco, Percocet, and other opiates. She had remembered the heartbreaking stories of people in her life who battled with opiate addiction and desperately wanted an alternative to the opiate medications her doctor prescribed her.
 
When a friend suggested CBD, she found that the cannabinoid indeed helped with some of her symptoms, opening her eyes to the possibility of cannabis. She began using THC, which helped her manage her pain and quit her Ambien prescription, but consuming THC on a regular basis left her feeling chronically high and interfered with her daily routine. After doing more research, she discovered the incredible medical benefits of THCa, one of the stronger cannabinoids that haven't been as widely utilized as THC or CBD. Under the guidance of Rev. Dr. Kymron deCesare from Steep Hill Labs, Erin learned more about THCa and started a daily regimen.
 
Today, she daily medicates with THCa and has replaced her opiate prescriptions with cannabis. Her life was changed in the best way possible. Her journey inspired her to share her knowledge with other patients looking for a healthier alternative to invasive and addictive pharmaceuticals. Thus, Edibles by E was created, with a mission to provide healthy edibles made with top-quality ingredients. Founded and run by compassionate and enthusiastic individuals, Edibles by E is here to help you achieve the fun, healthy, and pain-free life you deserve.
 
Products:
 
Edibles by E emphasizes the differences and choice between THC and THCa. All edibles come in both varieties, allowing patients to accurately dose with the option of a psychoactive or non-psychoactive medication.

4030,"MARIHUANA AND HEMP CROPS IN EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
 

 
The relationship between humans and hemp plants has an Ancient History. It was grown at the end of the Neolithic Era in China, India, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Ancient Greece.
 
Both cultivation and use of cannabis has always been a taboo issue in our societies. It had a very important role in our diet, medicine, it was used ceremonially and recreationally. Elaborate products where made from this raw material. Contrasting with Hinduism and Buddhism, Christianity has always denied “cannabis” divinity.
 
Modern Greek state started hemp growth for commercial purposes until its total prohibition in 1957. Greece, Turkey and Egypt became important hemp exporters. The use was legal and hemp was cultivated in fertile land such as the Peloponnese.
 

 
In 1870 Arcadia and Argolide counties ran hemp crops and marihuana growth. In the middle of the 19th century, Tripoli was the centre of hemp cultivation and trade. Georgios Makropoulos, the son of Tripolis mayor Athanasios Grigoropoulos was the first person to bring hemp seeds in Tripoli.
 
People were coming from Eastern Europe, Egypt and Cyprus to the municipality of Orchomenos in Mantinea to learn techniques on how to cultivate hemp. The newspaper “Moreas” informed that in 1904 the production in Mantinea was about 5.000.000 okades (64000 ton). Hash was exported to Egypt and the Middle-East.It was classified as one of the best in the world and it had an excellent reputation. Most of confiscations in Tunisia had a seal from Greek factories, mainly Stavros Kocaje of medicinal hemp and hash.
 
Every producer had a distinguishing and unique seal in their products. The elephant was the seal of Petros Karamanos landowner in Steno village. French traveller, Henry de Monfried, visited the family business in Steno to purchase hash. He said that there was a net organised by Greeks, he agreed to bring new customers and to get customs clearance for them. This net was made not only by marginal people, but also with educated people, men and women, together with necessary translators. They loaded the cargo from Steno and from Piraeus a Greek steam boat would take it to Marseille. The customer had the right to try the hash. The size of the flame was proportional to its quality. The harvest was during the night and hash was stored in a dark barn. After that, women sieved it on a special table and men put it in bowls to homogenize it. With a hydraulic press they were making it smaller in order to make transactions and transport easier.
 
This growth was stopped due to Britain’s Diplomatic and persistent pressure. They would stop purchasing Greek grapes unless the Greeks gave up growing hemp. There are two different versions of the British persistence.
 
The first one is about facing a huge problem with workers in Egypt which seemed that they smoked so much hash that it caused an alarming decrease in work performance. The second version was that many Indians were moving around the British Colonies. They wanted to grow hemp there because India was still a British Colony. As a result of this foreign policy, the Greek government imposed a tax and custom restrictions on hash in 1906. In 1919, The Treaty of Versailles stated that hemp cultivation and trade caused addiction and it had harmful effects on health. Greece followed the rest of European nations and under the law 7/11/1925 the ban for hemp trade was promulgated for ten years until the 1st of January 1936. The main goal was to sell out all the stock and import it all to avoid economic ruin. As a result, the hand labour started to decline in most workshops and landowners in Mantineia and they started to grow other crops. After Metaxas dictatorship, there were very strict measures about this issue. Consequently, hemp cultivation and trade disappeared. In the 1920 elections, Leridaios Alexandros Papanastasiou, who was a minister in the Venizelos presidency, arrived in Tripoli for his election. His countrymen had asked repeatedly to help with the suspension of the hemp ban. He not only ignored the petitions, but he also recommended developing more restrictive measures.
 
In 1932, the Greek Government bans both cultivation and possession of Indian hemp.
 

 

 

 

 
By following the old Eastern Mediterranean techniques we are reviving the traditional hash production using exclusively hemp (Sativa L.). As a result of this unique approach is the creation of a legal product with great potential.
 
It is not only used as a souvenir. The high percentage of CBD (3%-5,6% aprox) or CBG (3,68%- 48,51% aprox) makes the product suitable for other uses too! The medical products currently available in the market contain a CBD concentration on the same range as our product. This makes it an excellent help in aromatherapy.
 

 
All of our products follow the EU legislation regulations and are against animal testing.

2483,"Emerald Bay Extracts full-spectrum oil is packaged into syringes (for oral consumption) and tablets that allow for very specific and high dosing required by many medical patients. All of our products are strain-specific so patients can find the strains and effects that are most effective for their ailments and needs.

We truly believe that knowledge is power. Providing unparalleled customer education and support, clean and potent products and in-depth retailer training has allowed Emerald Bay Extracts to gain the confidence and trust of both novice and experienced users alike. We pride ourselves on building a brand that patients believe in. We open up lines of communication with our retailers and users to learn what works for them, provide the most benefits. Using this information and a science-based approach to tailor our products to provide strains and dosages that help individuals with a vast and complex range of symptoms, diseases, and conditions.




History:

Founded by a Stanford trained oncology and ICU nurse, Emerald Bay Extracts has developed a proprietary process for creating orally consumed full-spectrum cannabis oil that can vastly improve the quality of life of people suffering from chronic pain, tremors, and chemotherapy-induced nausea. While treating oncology patients, Casey noticed that some of her patients were self-prescribing cannabis to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy. After visiting a number of dispensaries and speaking with budtenders, it was apparent that there were few options and information available to patients and caregivers to guide them on their cannabis journey. 

​

Products:

Seeing the need for clean medical products in the California marketplace, Casey and Thomas developed their RSO using pesticide-free, heavy metal-free, and microbial-free, triple-tested cannabis plants. Material is hand-selected from small-batch farms in Mendocino, Humboldt, and the Sierra Nevada Foothills. Material is tested before entering the facility and again a second and third time before reaching the consumer. Emerald Bay Extracts full-spectrum oil is packaged into 1 gram syringes (for oral consumption) and 10mg, 25mg, 50mg tablets that allow for very specific and high dosing required by many medical patients. All of our products are strain-specific so patients can find the strains and effects that are most effective for their ailments and needs.




Lab Testing:

Prioritizing high quality and safe medical cannabis extracts, all Emerald Bay Extracts’ small batches are tested by California Ag Labs for potency, residual solvents, pesticides, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and terpene profiles, both before and after manufacturing.",,65,7b/7b7680199ac4fb041b36936b940af71a18f5bbbf.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/483/avatar/original/1606263120-small_logo.png,emeraldbayextracts,Emerald Bay Extracts,4,3,emerald-bay-extract,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/emerald-bay-extract,https://www.emeraldbayextracts.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

814,"Eva Seedsis amarijuana seeds bankwith headquarters in Spain,creator and producer of its own genetics and seeds.
 
We do not sell seeds of our genetics to other banks, nor do we buy seeds from other banks, thereforeour seeds can only be found under the brand Eva Seeds.
 
We do not do self-flowering varieties. We consider that there are already many banks offering this product and weprefer to continue to be a bank known for its quality varieties,and that is why we decided not to work on them to work hard to achievefast-flowering photo-dependant genetics.
 
Our short-flowering varieties are due to the work of selecting our varieties, without crossing with Ruderalis or self-flowering. It has nothing to do with the process of the Fast Version in the market, which is crossed with Ruderalis (the plant which provides the self-flowering gene). Thereforeour seeds are fast-flowering photo-dependant feminised varieties, yet they arenot Fast Version or self-flowering.
 
Our seeds are not sold in bulk(outside their original packet). The problem of the bulk seeds is that they are usually copies of the original, and therefore the brands and variety names are discredited and it takes advantage of the banks that are actually producers and that dedicate a lot of time to the task of selecting to be able to offer new flavours, yields and effects. In addition, and above all, as they come without the original package it is very difficult to know the origin of the bulk seeds, and you risk the harvest, time and money.
 
We do not sell by the unit. Although we know that it is a format requested, we consider thatit is the task of the Grow Shop worker, to teach the grower and make him understand that a genetics can not be valued with one single specimen. Don't risk it all on one single card!
 
Request your EVA SEEDS catalogues, when placing your order with the distributor. We print in Spain and Chile and they should always be available for you. If not, and your distributor does not have any, contact us to fix the situation.

Eva Seedses unbanco de semillas de marihuanacon sede en España,creador y productor de sus propias genéticas y semillas.
 
No vendemos semillas de nuestras genéticas a otros bancos, ni compramos semillas de otros bancos, por lo quenuestras semillas sólo se pueden encontrar bajo la marca Eva Seeds.
 
No hacemos variedades auto florecientes. Consideramos que ya hay muchos bancos ofreciendo este producto y nosotrospreferimos seguir siendo un banco reconocido por la calidad las variedades, es por ello que decidimos no trabajar en ellas para trabajar duro en conseguirgenéticas foto dependientes de rápida floración.
 
Nuestras variedades de corta floración se deben al trabajo de selección de nuestras variedades, sin cruzar con Ruderalis o autoflorecientes. No tiene nada que ver con el proceso que tienen las Fast Version que hay en el mercado, que sí están cruzadas con Ruderalis (la planta que aporta el gen de autofloración). Por lo tantonuestras semillas son variedades feminizadas fotodependientes de floración rápida, perono son Fast Version ni autoflorecientes.
 
Nuestras semillas no se venden a granel(fuera de su paquete original). El problema del granel, es que suelen ser copias del original, por lo que desprestigia las marcas y nombres de variedades y se aprovecha de los bancos que son realmente productores y que dedican mucho tiempo al trabajo de selección para poder ofrecer nuevos sabores, producciones y efectos. Además y sobre todo, al ir sin su envase original, es muy difícil saber el origen de las semillas a granel, por lo cual arriesgas la cosecha, el tiempo y el dinero.
 
No vendemos por unidad. Aunque sabemos que es un formato demandado, consideramos quees labor del trabajador de Grow Shop, educar al cultivador y hacerle entender que no se puede valorar una genética con un solo ejemplar. No arriesgues todo a una sola carta!

Extraterrestrial proudly supplies medical cannabis products of extraordinary quality and stellar effects. From high-quality extractions like shatter and distillate cartridges to Extraterrestrial’s edibles and topicals, every product exudes remarkable purity and potency. Extraterrestrial is synchronized with the cannabis industry, operating on the cutting edge of the latest technology and production techniques. Send your senses to the outer reaches of your universe, and discover how premium cannabis products can enhance your wellness. 

History 
The founder began to experiment with cannabis extraction in 2011. As a medical cannabis patient himself, he was apprehensive about the sourcing and practices that produced his medicine. “If you want something done right, you must do it yourself,” rang true for this cannabusiness founder and he started to create his own cannabis products. He sharpened his skills and sought the best training and education in cannabis concentrates. Year after year he upgraded his equipment and kept a sharp eye on the latest and greatest in extraction innovation. Cannabis concentrates were still new to the cannabis community of Phoenix with little in-depth information available about extractions. People were afraid of concentrates, and the founder spent much of Extraterrestrial’s early days enlightening the public on concentrates’ benefits. After four years of research and development Extraterrestrial launched in 2015 to officially unveil its line of cannabis concentrates, tinctures and edibles. 

Process
Extraterrestrial’s team shoots for the stars when crafting its cannabis products; every hand involved provides an integral piece to the quality of the product. High-quality starting material is essential to the integrity of the final product. Extraterrestrial sources its flowers from a network of premium cannabis gardens. All associated farms are toured by the founder to ensure their cultivation practices are synonymous with Extraterrestrial values and standards. From there, those premium flowers are processed to craft concentrates for edibles, tinctures, vaping and dabbing. 

Products
Extraterrestrial offers a variety of cannabis-derived products ranging from distillate vape cartridges to marijuana-infused lotions. An Extraterrestrial cartridge is a hot item in Phoenix. The gravity of premium quality distillate pulls patients into an orbit of pain-free euphoria. Cartridges aren't the only extraction to explore. Heat up the banger or e-nail and drop in a piece of Extraterrestrial shatter for an experience unlike any other. Nourish your skin and activate your endocannabinoid system with Extraterrestrial’s topicals, such as a cannabis lotion that banishes pain into a black-hole leaving you to traverse the cosmos pain-free. 

Lab Testing
The safety and efficacy of Extraterrestrial's other-worldly products are vital to the team, and all products are lab tested by C4 Labs for pesticides, residual solvents, and cannabinoid content.",,110,3f/3f142a9385972cdbce4c2ad71717bfb87ea89087.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/676/avatar/original/1600577118-placeholder-600x400.png,,Extraterrestrial,4.72222232818604,6,extra-terrestrial,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/extra-terrestrial,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concentrates Kings made a breakthrough in their laboratory when they finally perfected their closed loop system, which allowed them to create more pure, clean extractions than “open blasted” extraction methods.

2057,"Cosmic cannabis creations
 
 
 
Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles is the synergistic result of one man’s love for cannabis and skill in culinary. As a longstanding cannabis advocate who worked on the development of Proposition 215 in the mid-‘90s, David proudly shares the infused foods of his labor with new and old cannabis consumers alike. Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles offers a line of delicious, handmade treats infused with organic cannabis from local farms.
 
 
 
History
 
David has been part of the cannabis movement for decades. While living in a tree during his collegial years in Humboldt, he became politically involved in cannabis advocacy. After leaving school he began to unfold the history of cannabis, discovering that prohibition was a racist corporate interest that kept so many from holistic relief. This spurred a lifelong rebellion against cannabis prohibition, and in 1995 David was pleased to work with Chris Wilder and Ben Rice on Proposition 215. When the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 was passed, David’s heart soared, though there was -- and still is -- a lot of work to do. As a young chef, he continued his work in advocacy and sharing the truth about cannabis with the public.
 
 
 
On Thanksgiving day of 2016, David came up with an idea. He envisioned combining his more than two decades of culinary experience with his love for cannabis. There are always obstacles for start-up cannabusinesses, and without huge financial bandwidth getting his name out there was tough. He never allowed the irony of his situation to cause dismay, even while seeing newcomers without a genuine regard for the plant come into the industry riding a wave of capital. He knew in his heart that with hard work and dedication true cannabis would prevail as it always had. On February of 2017, Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles had their first product launch, and have since introduced many other delicious creations. Today, Cosmo D's has their sights set on savory cannabis-infused foods. Follow them on Weedmaps to stay in the loop for David’s latest culinary cannabis masterpiece.
 
 
 
Process
 
Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles are made by the founder's own hands, applying the skill from 25 years as an Executive Chef to his new cannabusiness. Cosmo D’s changes the landscape of edibles with their unique flavor profiles -- every edible is a work of art. David sources Sativa-dominant flowers from local, organic farms in Santa Cruz and Mendicino. Every product from Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles is crafted with a blend of nug-run flowers infused into cannabudder, coconut oil, or olive oil. Experience an elevated level of euphoria and flavor that is out of this world.
 
 
 
David puts a lot of thought into the product line for Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles. When David was creating his Toasted Coconut edible, he decided caramel would be the perfect add-in. He was beginning to head to the store, then asked himself why he would purchase caramel when he knows how to make it from scratch. He whipped up some homemade caramel and infused the ooey-gooey concoction with cannabis. Once complete, he was ready to try his Swiss milk chocolate, butterscotch chips and toasted coconut topped with a ribbon of caramel. His wife found him blissful, euphoric, and couch-locked; which was then he realized he infused the treat and the caramel topping. She turned to him and said, “That’s Extra Toasted Coconut.”
 



 
Products
 
The Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles are loved by all walks of life in the cannabis community. A go-to favorite is their Snickerdoodle Rice Crispy combining two delicious treats in one cannabis-infused confection. Folks with a hankering for dark chocolate can’t keep their hands off of Cosmo D’s Cosmic Berry Crunch, made with Belgian dark chocolate, dried cranberries, blueberries, goji berries, toffee, and white chocolate chips. Los Angelenos’ go crazy for their Chocolate Vegan Crumble, made from a delicious blend of dark chocolate, flax seeds, figs, dried currants, organic granola, and a hint of ginger.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
Safety and purity are paramount in food and medicine, which is why Cosmo D’s Outrageous Edibles is pleased to offer cannabis infused treats that are lab tested multiple times. The flowers used are tested for pesticides and potency, then the decarboxylated cannabudder or oils are tested to ensure the correct potency. Cosmo D’s final product receives analysis as well.",,634,77/77acff2bff1c2eae1ea53281a3876ce9e06edf1e.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/057/avatar/original/1503090574-COSMO-Ds_LOGO.jpg,,Cosmo D's Edibles,4.95104885101318,226,cosmo-ds-edibles,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/cosmo-ds-edibles,,,,,,,,,,,,

2377,"OGs fit for a king
 
Crown Genetics is the award-winning creator of the Crown OG. As one of the leading flower brands focused on proving only the best varieties of OG in the cannabis industry, Crown Genetics has become synonymous with superior genetics that is considered royalty. With the Crown OG, Dizzy OG, and Green Suicide, CG reigns supreme when it comes to fire flower.
 
History:
 
Before it became the cannabis kingdom it is now, Crown Genetics came from humble beginnings. In 2012, two buddies with a passion for marijuana cultivation banded together and swore to see the industry move into a commercialized direction. They began by working with OG genetics to breed something original and unique, a strain that marijuana smokers of all kinds could enjoy. Their creation: Crown OG.
 
While in many ways a traditional OG, the Crown OG has a potency that cannot be denied with sweet piney flavors and heavy Indica effects.
 
They started taking their new creation/signature strain to dispensaries throughout the San Fernando Valley. Immediately dispensaries started stocking their shelves with the newest Indica strain, only to see it sell out just as quickly. With appearances at numerous events in the area and branded shirts featuring the flower, word of mouth quickly spread that the Crown OG was the fire flower to get your hands on. Crown Genetics was officially on the map.
 
Their Crown OG strain was extracted and entered into their first cannabis cup. Crown OG took home 3rd place in “Best Indica Concentrate” in the 2012 High Times Cannabis Cup. With their first award under their belt, they soon became friends with Dizzy Wright, an American rapper from Las Vegas, and collaborated to create Dizzy OG. Intended as a gift to his cannabis smoking fans, Dizzy OG became the second in classic strain in Crown Genetics growing empire.
 
Currently, Crown Genetics is still perfecting their third OG strain: Green Suicide. A strain bred with Juicy J and perfection in mind, Crown Genetics continues to add to their story as one of the most influential flower brands in the cannabis community.
 
Process:
 
Crown Genetics secret to perfecting their genetics is no secret at all: attention to detail. CG grows their indoor flower in smaller rooms with fewer lights to have more climate and environment control. While giant warehouses with huge rooms of 40-50 lights may make for impressive yields, they often generate subpar buds in comparison to Crown Genetics smaller, 15-20 light rooms. Smaller batches may make for a lower yield, but they also make for more aromatic, flavorful, and potent flower.
 
Product:
 
Crown Genetics has won multiple awards due to their line of OG strains: Crown OG, Dizzy OG, and Green Suicide. All incredible OG strains, all fan favorites. The Crown OG is a powerful Indica with SFG OG and King Louis in its lineage. Although substantial body highs will follow, it provides a great euphoric buzz along with piney flavors. Dizzy OG was created exclusively for Dizzy OG, as a thank you to his weed smoking fans. A cross between Crown OG and King Louis, this is a heavy Indica of the highest quality. Green Suicide is a collaboration between Juicy J that is still in the development phase. Public opinions and a constant drive for refinement keep this brilliant strain inching closer and closer to perfection.",,3071,9c/9c42424d9827c7d9949de3393b3c01b09ad3be2d.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/377/avatar/original/1648783574-crown_og-420-2022.jpg,,Crown Genetics,4.01470565795898,17,crown-genetics,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/crown-genetics,https://crownog.com,,,,,,,,,,,

Dabble was founded on a passion for marijuana: a life-changing, eye-opening opportunity to create healing plant products that have the power to change the world. Dabble crafts high-quality concentrates from the highest grade materials available, dedicated to transparency and customer satisfaction with every new extract they create. Offering true medication, Dabble is proud to produce a product they can stand behind, and would even recommend to their closest familiar member. Clean, trusted, top shelf-Dabble gets the job done, every time.




Products:

Dabble creates concentrates in many forms, from Shatter, Wax, and Budder to Live Resin, Vape Cartridges, Fresh Frozen, Edible Oil, and Sugar Wax. 

DabbleExtracts products are widely available in Colorado dispensaries. Searchable through www.Dabbleextracts.com , WeedMaps, and Instagram: @dabbleextracts

We are consistently innovating and evolving our products to maintain the highest levels of purity, taste and experience for our customers and patients. 




History:

The founders of Dabble carry nearly a decade’s worth of working in the cannabis industry. Owner Josh Hindi began working with his own grow, moved through the industry managing a dispensary, and now runs Dabble as the sole overseer of their two facilities. Dabble started as a company called Cold Baked in 2012, initially infusing their cannabis into infused edibles. In 2014, they wanted to start working in concentrates, and eventually Dabble was born. Their mission always was to offer patients an alternative relief to pills and prescriptions and Dabble set themselves apart by being the cleanest, most effective concentrate brand on the market. Seeing marijuana's enormous potential to help people, from pain relief to relaxing with friends, Dabble’s duty is to advance and protect the Colorado cannabis community through offering a professional, reputable line of extracts.

 

Process:

At the start of their concentrates’ lifespan, Dabble sources their genetics from wholesale and client-based cultivators, only working with the most reputable growers in Colorado. Once they bring their own grow online, Dabble soon will source exclusive strains and terpene profiles from their personal collection. Dabble’s extracts are crafted from fully-compliant, closed loop systems that utilize hydrocarbon solvents. Their dedication to full terpene and THC retention, customer service, and cleanliness in their procedures are what set their concentrates apart from the crowd.

 




 Lab Testing:

 Dabble continually lab tests their batches of extracts, collaborating with Gobi Analytical and Phytatech Labs to test for a full spectrum report. Each of their concentrates is checked for pesticides, microbials, potency, terpene profiles, and residual solvents.",https://www.facebook.com/DabbleExtracts,360,cb/cb523c9f925494fff153ac65028450e550abb8b4.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/834/avatar/original/dabbleextracts_logo200x200.jpg,https://www.instagram.com/dabbleextracts/?hl=en,DABBLE EXTRACTS,4.19999980926514,6,dabble-extracts,https://twitter.com/dabbleextracts,https://weedmaps.com/brands/dabble-extracts,http://www.dabbleextracts.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

Dabstract is the convergence of a fervent passion for cannabis, people, and science -- a brand that embodies marijuana concentrates at their best. Dabstract was founded upon and operates under four pillars: The People, The Plant, The Ethos, The Planet.

 

For the team, cannabis is about people and providing access to safe, premium quality concentrates. Dabstract strives to empower individuals through the use of cannabis, whether out of medical necessity or personal enjoyment. The marijuana plant is the fuel and driving force behind Dabstract’s passion. The team continually deepens its understanding of cannabis’ various components as they reveal themselves with time and research. Dabstract’s ethos guides it to provide the cleanest, safest extractions with transparent practices and lab-tested quality assurance. The planet is everyone’s home, and Dabstract’s team makes every effort to be good stewards by using sustainable practices with minimal environmental impact.

 

From its extraction artists to your dab rig, Dabstract supplies excellence. The Dabstract team cordially invite you to experience premium cannabis concentrates.

 

History

The Dabstract team produced its first cannabis oils at the start of the millennium. A group of friends who shared a common bond of their love of marijuana was keen to what was happening in California’s medical cannabis movement. The team moved to the west coast to chase the cultural renaissance beginning to unfold.

 

“It was the opening to a door of consciousness and enlightenment of sensibilities that have led us to right here, and right now.”

 

From the start the team was sure of one fact; if you offer people something they cannot turn down, you will never have to worry about where your products are going to go. The founders set out to align themselves with the best of the best in all aspects. They connected with people who were taking cannabis in the right direction, networking with skilled master growers, and seeking the best genetics and innovators in the field.

 

Building a team was half the battle. Dabstract has sharpened itsswords with trial and error, lessons learned, and years of riding the peaks and pitfalls of the industry. Dabstract has experienced the cannabis industry from its infancy and since have collected a wealth of insight. Now, those years of experience have enabled Dabstract to consistently deliver what it does best --cannabis extraction.

 

Process

Quality starts with square one. Dabstract’s affiliated cannabis gardens employ cultivation practices that respect the plant and the planet. From there, the high-quality starting material is brought to Dabstract’s facility for extraction. The extraction artists purge their oils to perfection and take every necessary step to ensure the final product is nothing but 100% pure, cannabis oils. The results are concentrates with unparalleled terpene signatures and cannabinoid profiles, delivering flavorful, potent dabs and vaporizable materials.",,367,75/75f32bb3bc28daed4146ca16b0f36b9e263090fc.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/141/avatar/original/DABSRACT-LOGO.jpg,,Dabstract,4.11111116409302,6,dabstract-llc,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/dabstract-llc,,,,,,,,,,,,

2241,"Cultivating fine cannabis is an art, similar to brewing the perfect cup of coffee or craft beer. At Dawg Star, they understand the ideal combination of rest, nutrients, genetics, environment, and processing that result in an optimal crop of cannabis. Combining years of marijuana experience, a thriving passion for the plant, and a tenacity to revolutionize the industry, Dawg Star sets new high standards of excellence in Washington cannabis. They invest care and mastery at every step of the cultivation process, yielding a final cannabis product greater than the sum of its parts. Simply designed and beautifully crafted, Dawg Star makes enjoying the finest marijuana a natural part of an elevated lifestyle.
 
 
 
History:
 
The first spark of inspiration for Dawg Star Cannabis began more than a decade ago, where the founding team made a pact to share their cannabis cultivation knowledge with the newly forming industry. Calling Washington home, they realized the current regulatory framework would need much shaping before it could truly help patients. The Dawg Star team opened one of Washington’s first marijuana clinics to help patients obtain high-quality cannabis treatment, later building one of the first cooperative grows and dispensary chains to aid patients across the state. Slowly, they continued lobbying for change in the cannabis community, establishing the CCSE and helping Washington legislators create i502. After more than a decade of legislative action, Dawg Star Cannabis officially launched to share their cultivation with the world, once again leading the marijuana industry to the highest standards through action.
 
 
 
Products:
 
Dawg Star categorizes their cannabis in three groups: Mind (Sativa), Body (Indica), and Mood (Hybrid). They start with their collection of award-winning genetics, and cultivate many new strains.r. Dawg Star’s vegetative grow process produces cannabis plants larger, healthier and more yielding during their flowering process. Their continuous flowering rotation allows Dawg Star to harvest more than 50 crops per year, with consistent and seasonal strains populating their menu. From fan favorite Gorilla Glue #4 to their seasonal Dragon Breath and Critical Purple, Dawg Star specializes in A-Z cannabis excellence.

De La Beuh marries skincare with cannabis luxury. Offering a colorful line of cannabis-infused bath bombs, scrubs and more, De La Beuh eases a variety of health issues while soothing the soul. Their products’ highest quality cannabis and natural essential oils smell amazing, are exciting to use, and offer therapeutic effects to banish your troubles away. With award-winning products and delectable scents, De La Beuh’s bliss is only a bath bomb away.
 
History:
 
Leanna Friedman launched De La Beuh after noticing a lack in cannabis-infused skincare and bath products within the industry. With a history of family skin concerns, Friedman knew a bath bomb with cannabis would be beneficial to many patients with similar concerns. She was inspired by Lush Cosmetics, and after months of making edibles only for her friends, she decided to combine the two and venture out into the cannabis market. Her history within the cannabis industry began years before helped her to navigate the early days of forming her cannabis-filled goods, and mastering formulation. Within months of forming, De La Beuh won Chalice 2016 for their coffee scrub, and since then they’ve grown exponentially. They partner with professional skincare companies to continuously improve their formulas, and De La Beuh products feature in sixty dispensaries across California. Soon, De La Beuh wants to expand to other legal states, and feature their CBD products in dermatologists and other skin wellness centers across the country.
 
Process:
 
De La Beuh collaborates with master players in the growing industry, using carefully crafted cannabis as the source of all of their skincare products. They then introduce essential oils into the equation, capitalizing on the many benefits each oil provides via aromatherapy and allowing their products to sooth a range of health issues. Never settling for inferior ingredients, De La Beuh then uses their proprietary method of infusing their utterly pure cannabis into their products. Thanks to this process, De La Beuh products have one High Times, Chalice, Blazer’s Cup, and been on the cover of LA Times and featured in LA Weekly.
 
Products:
 
De La Beuh crafts a variety of skin care products, all crafted to soothe, relax, and heal. Their lavender bath bomb and scrub are among their most popular scents, and their coffee scrub is the recipient of several awards. De La Beuh also crafts seasonal bath bombs with fun, creative colors that always sell out. Every few months they switch up their offerings, and keep a selection of 5 consistent scents always available for their long-term canna-fans.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Working with SC Labs, De La Beuh lab tests all of their skincare products for potency, pesticides, residual solvents and other contaminants to ensure purity and quality of goods.
 
Networks:
 
De La Beuh features their THC products in dispensaries across LA and Orange County, with a few select shops available in Sacramento, San Diego, and Las Vegas. Places such as MedMen, the Kind Center, The Weed in Studio City, New Amsterdam Naturals and Essence in Las Vegas feature their bath bombs, and curious customers can order their CBD products directly from their website.",,147,2b/2b47be2da657ae0fa2f654943c0f881230f1276a.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/567/avatar/original/new_de-la-beuh_logo.jpg,,De La Beuh,5,13,de-la-beuh,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/de-la-beuh,,,,,,,,,,,,

1983,"Denver Dab Co. provides the most pure, highest quality concentrates through superior processing and testing standards. All while empowering consumers with knowledge of the significant medicinal benefits of cannabis extracts.
 
Extraction - our process begins with carefully sourced n-butane/n-propane to ensure the highest purity solvents, that we then triple-distill to remove any contaminants.
 
After extracting the concentrate with our 2017 Precision PX1, the concentrate begins it’s minimum 5 days/100hr purge cycle - which means our residual profiles are typically 20 ppm or less. This far exceeds the state requirements.
 
Also we are constantly monitoring this fast paced extracts industry, and updating our processes accordingly to keep up with industry innovations.
 
Testing - although testing is not currently required for medical companies, we believe our patients deserve to know their medicine is safe for consumption.
 
Accordingly, we test all material for pesticides before we begin the extraction process, and if material tests positive it is immediately returned to the dispensary of origin.
 
Furthermore, we test for residual solvents, terpenes, and potency – these results are printed on the interior of each package, so our patients are as informed as possible when consuming our DDC products.
 
Found in the same glands that produce cannabinoids like THC and CBD, terpenes are the pungent oils that provide varieties of cannabis with distinctive flavors such as citrus, berry, mint, and pine.
 
Scientists have recently discovered that terpenes play a much larger role in the medicinal benefits of cannabis than previously thought. Not only does the terpene profile of a strain dictate its unique flavor and aroma, terpenes also play a key role in determining the effect cannabis has on our bodies. it is not only about the total level of terpenes present in a given strain, more important is their specific proportion to one another.

History
 
The founders of Detroit Growers Extracts are industry experts with several years of experience in the cannabis industry. Since the legalization of medicinal cannabis in Michigan, they have faithfully served the medical marijuana community of Detroit. As time marched forward, the team expanded their methodologies to include extraction and making edibles. Properly dosing edibles is a tricky task, but the team found the perfect formula. Once every aspect of their operation was dialed in, it was time to put a name to the products so many Detroit patients relied on and enjoyed. So they did – Detroit Growers launched in 2014 and remain Michigan patients source of premium cannabis edibles and concentrates ever since.
 
 
 
Process
 
All Detroit Growers Extracts products begin at an indoor cannabis garden tended by master growers with years of experience. With careful consideration of every input, the Detroit Growers Extracts farm yields some of the finest flowers in Michigan.
 
 
 
Post-harvest those buds are processed by their extraction artists who use medical-grade butane to render the cleanest and safest concentrates. They isolate the most desirable characteristics from their strains leaving only the cannabinoids and terpenes, then purge any remaining residual solvents.
 
 
 
Products
 
Each batch of shatter from Detroit Growers Extracts hail from unique or exotic strain varieties, and all express the essence of the original cultivar. Let the potent venom of Golden Cobra Shatter melt in your banger or e-nail. This limited release strain is the result of Grape Kush x Tangie and supplies a splash of flavor with every dab. Two more citrusy options include Lemon-Walker OG and Lemon Ice Shatter, both deliver sharp lemon notes and sweeping euphoria. Lastly, Blueberry Pie x Purple Diesel NR Shatter exhibits a masterful blend of two Nug Run strains cultivated to their maximum potential then cured and extracted to perfection.

Upon witnessing the benefits first hand, our belief in this wonderful plant grew to the point where it became the driving force in our lives. We were already making CBD tinctures and began branching out into making CBD balms and eventually edibles. With the amount of people now coming to us asking for advice on CBD and where to get it, coupled with a building of trust with our respected CBD supplier, it made sense to look to start our own business.

Quality, to us, is more than a promise, it stands for true value and reliability. Only if you can prove the quality you claim it becomes more than a promise. And quality is our highest principle. Therefore, you can download and review all our quality tests and certificates right here. They are sorted by product and the respective product batches.

Production:

Production of our products takes place under strictly controlled conditions in Austria. Delivering the best quality products is of utmost importance to us, which is why every production batch of Cannexol 5% CBD Oil undergoes strict quality tests. Check out the quality test results.

Our products are 100% natural and are therefore subject to slight fluctuations in terms of content, consistency, odour and colour. 

Quality features:

All of our CBD oils are full-spectrum oils. Using organic hemp seed as a basis, the oils contain a natural content of cannabidiol. This means that all valuable ingredients found in the industrial hemp plant cannabis sativa are also found in our Cannexol oils. The careful extraction process using CO2 makes this possible. 

All Cannexol oils are ARGE-CANNA certified. ARGE-CANNA is the first independent quality seal for CBD products. Since providing high-quality products is our core value we also subject each product batch to internal and external quality tests. Our Cannexol oils are vegan, gluten-free, lactose free and non-GMO. 

Shelf life:

See packaging. If you adhere to the storage recommendations, shelf life is guaranteed as indicated on the bottle. In all CBD oils, the consistency can vary slightly.

1424,"Care By Design unlocks the power of nature’s genius through our cutting edge science. We pioneered CBD to THC ratios that deliver powerful relief. Our tinctures, soft gels, vapes, edibles and topicals are made with cannabis oil safely extracted from sungrown, high CBD cannabis varieties. Our full spectrum CBD oil is rich in phytocannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes, and all of our products are triple tested for consistent, precise dosing you can trust.




In recent years, we’ve researched and innovated to offer cannabis wellness with unparalleled efficacy. Our newly formulated ratio line goes beyond CBD and THC, harnessing the full therapeutic potential of the cannabis plant. We have reformulated our tinctures and soft gels to be more potent and effective than ever before. We’ve increased our cannabinoid count by at least 25% per ratio and added the minor but mighty cannabinoids, CBDa and THCa.




Backed by a team of expert cultivators, in-house scientists and caregivers, Care By Design exists to radically improve the lives of individuals and raise the baseline wellbeing of our communities. 




Process:




Care By Design formulates all of their products in our state-of-the-art laboratory and sterile, clean room. Utilizing non-volatile CO2 extraction methods, Care By Design unlocks the full spectrum of cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids from sungrown cannabis, grown sustainably throughout California. We then work in our lab to create a variety of cannabinoid ratios, allowing consumers to control or eliminate psychoactivity to their preference. 




Products:




Our products are made with cannabis oil that is safely extracted from sun-grown, whole-plant, high-CBD cannabis strains. Our wide assortment of CBD: THC ratios and product forms allow for truly individualized cannabinoid wellness. We offer ratios of CBD:THC in 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1, 18:1 and 40:1. Our ratios are available in 5 formats: tinctures, soft gels, gummies, vapes and topical. 




Lab Testing:




Care By Design cares about the consistent, excellent quality of our products, and takes every step to ensure reliable cannabis quality and dosing. Every product made by Care By Design is always ‘triple-tested’. An independent third-party laboratory runs extensive safety and potency testing on the cannabis plant material we source from the farm, then test the oil that we extract from the cannabis, and finally we test the final manufactured and packaged product. That final testing step results in a Certificate of Analysis (COA) being issued, which is an official document that confirms that a product has accurate label claims and complies with state testing and quality requirements.

Socially conscious cannabis cultivation.
 
 
 
CascadeHigh matches a professional understanding of health and treatment with an in depth knowledge of both the cannabis plant and farming techniques. They combine this expertise to sustainably raise cannabis flower of some of the best quality and potency around. Strictly adhering to their Triple-P principle -- People, Planet and Profits in that order --CascadeHigh knows that real success comes from investing in giving people the best cannabis, using the most sustainable and healthy cultivation techniques. Their cannabis products heal anyone in need of the power of this plant, and CascadeHigh proudly advocates for its rightful place in the forefront of both the adult-use market and medical system.
 
History:
 
The founder of CascadeHigh traces his growing experience back to 2000 in Oregon, working as a nurse and a long-time researcher of cannabis. Throughout his experience, he has seen cannabis help people across the medical spectrum and after many years, he wanted to fully invest his experience as an ethical, medical professional in the cannabis industry. He officially founded CascadeHigh in November 2014 to see organizations treat the plant with the respect he knew it deserved. Growing in fits and starts, CascadeHigh transitioned in 2016 from an OHA to an OLCC cultivator, overcoming both legal and financial obstacles to make their carefully crafted cannabis available to as broad an audience as possible. Today, CascadeHigh is positioned to fully come online, expanding their craft cannabis to thirty dispensaries by the end of the year and offering consistent distribution across the board so that no patient will go without their medicine and all adult users can enjoy the finest clean cannabis.
 
Process:
 
CascadeHigh specializes in cultivating flowers perfect for both curing and extraction. Using purely organic methods, they grow their crops with water-only cultivation, using no pesticides or nutrients and giving their plants healthy, living microbial soil so the plant can do the rest of the work. Sourcing their genetics from local Oregon cultivators across the state, their farm offers a variety of cannabis medicine with high potency. Their oil processor, CO2 Dynamics, uses solvent-less extraction methods to produce pure cannabis oil. CascadeHigh is proud to partner with a company that matches their strong commitment to patient-centric ethics.
 
Products:
 
The cannabis flowers from CascadeHigh offer potent and healthy effects perfect for both adult use and medical consumers, grown using the most stringently sustainable methodologies. Individuals love their Pineapple Flower strain, a phenotype of Ed Rosenthal’s Super Bud with sativa effects and powerful tropical flavors. Additional favorites include their Jedi Kush, a potent full mind indica hybrid, and their powerfully sweet Durban Poison. Their high CBD strains ACDC, Cannatonic, and Franks Gift are very popular with those looking for the powerful healing properties of CBD without the psychoactive effect.
 
Lab Testing:
 
CascadeHigh lab tests all of their products, in adherence with the OLCC requirements for cannabis quality standards and terpene analysis which they use as a tool to help guide their cultivation techniques. Submitting their materials to Green Leaf Labs, they test for water activities, pesticides, potency, cannabinoids, terpenes and residual materials in their oil.
 
Networks:
 
Currently, CascadeHigh’s carefully grown cannabis can be found in Farma and Gras Cannabis, both in Portland Oregon, La Mota in Beaverton and Green Man Collective on the coast and are rapidly increasing their distribution network statewide. Their plan includes growth beyond more than thirty dispensaries by the end of 2017.",,177,e9/e91005e02a5995ab5bb981331471596a89f59981.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/512/avatar/original/cascadehigh-organics_logo.jpg,,CascadeHigh,5,0,cascadehigh-organics,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/cascadehigh-organics,,,,,,,,,,,,

With an interest in the medical benefits of all cannabinoids we have also created various genetic strains, with carefully balanced make ups, many of which are now used under licence by other companies.
 
Our work is centered around scientific research, using gas chromagraph analysis and implanting genetic markers in all our strains.
 
Our objective is to ensure a high quality product and to provide a platform for training and for research, individually tailored to the needs of our customers.
 
We are committed to research, taking care of our customers and the promotion of healthy living.",,49,c9/c954b7cf87984bba90cb298af20fea43f484ed80.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/471/avatar/original/1508267355-cbd-botanic.jpg,,CBD Botanic,1,1,cbd-botanic,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/cbd-botanic,,,,,,,,,,,,

1850,"CBD For The People named themselves after their core mission: The People. Dedicated to offering all-natural, healing CBD products at an affordable price, CBD For The People bridges the gap between patient and medicine. They believe every person should be able to grow cannabis as medicine in their backyard, but as these are confusing times, CBD For The People puts this great medicine in the people’s hands. CBD For The People’s organically crafted CBD tinctures offer high-dosage relief for a fraction of the cost, and everything from seed to sale is done to take care of the people, first and foremost.
 
History:
 
The founders of CBD For The People began their work in February 2017, after years of service working in the cannabis industry from deliveries to larger CBD organizations. As they worked, they were shocked at the immense price differences in CBD products compared to THC and disdained the greed of companies charging nearly astronomically high prices for even small dose products. Committed to fighting this system, they started CBD For The People to offer patients a high mg CBD medicine they could afford. They always prioritize their patients, and everything they do centers around offering the cleanest possible CBD product at the most affordable prices.
 
Process:
 
CBD For The People crafts their products alongside their raw, natural and vegan-centered philosophies. All of their cannabis flowers and oils are organically and sustainably sourced, clean of pesticides, and never infused with artificial flavors or chemicals. They mix their Amsterdam-sourced CO2-extracted CBD oil with organic MCT coconut oil, offering a delicious tea-like taste that’s then infused with raw fruit and flavor extracts. Traceable from seed to shelf, CBD For The People’s tinctures are free of microbes, pesticides, residual solvents and heavy metals, offering the raw benefits of the healing cannabis plant solely.
 
Products:
 
Catering to patient palettes of varied tastes, CBD For The People's high potency and delicious tinctures are available in a range of milligram dosages and flavors, all while keeping their prices as affordable as possible. Their labels offer options with and without a cannabis leaf, allowing for discreet medication when the need arises. Available in 10ml, 15ml, and 30ml sizes, CBD For The People’s dosings range from 200 mg to 3100 mg per bottle, flavored with natural ingredients such as Raw Orange, Raw Lemon, and Raw Peppermint.
 
Lab Testing:
 
CBD For The People deeply cares about the quality of their tinctures, lab testing each batch of their cannabis products to ensure they offer the best possible medicine to their valued patients. Working with SC Labs and other California-based laboratories, CBD FTP checks for a full spectrum test of terpenoids, residual solvents, pesticides, microbiological contaminants, and potency.
 
Networks:
 
As a pure CBD product, CBD For The People’s tinctures distribute to suffering patients across the United States, as well in featured Southern California dispensaries. Locals can check out their tinctures at OC3, Hempire Meds, Six- Star, Mesa and many more, and CBD FTP looks forward to growing their circle to offer patients everywhere affordable, organic CBD medicine.",,456,23/23d929bcdf06ec9aa96ca20293f4850665b5b7a6.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/850/avatar/original/cbdforthepeople-logo200x200.jpg,,CBD For The People,4.59459447860718,27,cbd-for-the-people,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/cbd-for-the-people,,,,,,,,,,,,

4949,"CBD Relieve was founded back in September 2016. After researching the market extensively and after numerous visits / meetings with experts and suppliers in the USA, we knew we had to introduce this product to the UK market as soon as possible
 
Whilst CBD was relatively unheard of in the UK, we launched our first product, our 100mg CBD e-liquid which features 5 flavours. Based on the popularity of this product, we then increased the strength range to 200mg and then introduced a 300mg due to popular demand
 
We went from strength to strength and spent the best part of 12 months developing more ranges which led us on to our oral tincture range for sublingual absorption as another method of administering CBD. We started with an entry level strength of 500mg and after such a successful response, we followed up with a 1000mg and have recently launched a 2500mg
 
We were then receiving enquiries on a daily basis asking for a vape kit designed for non vapers. This led us to the development of our CBD Relieve Vape Kit and Pre-Filled Cartridge range. This kit has been designed with the non vaper in mind. You simply screw your cartridge onto your battery and vape away! When the cartridge is empty, throw it in the bin and open a new one
 
After realising that the UK market was much bigger than first anticipated, we then continued on to launch our Pure CBD Crystal Isolate. Our newest product arrivals include our 1g and 3g full spectrum, rich hemp oil, CBD body oil and high strength CBD body balm with another 6 products at development stages
 
At present, CBD Relieve is now stocked into over 200+ vape shops, wellness centres and independent pharmacies around the UK alone, we have multiple customers in Europe and have recently opened our first dedicated specialist CBD Relieve outlet in a prime shopping centre is St Helens. We have put pen to paper for another 6 sites located in mainstream shopping centres",,39,4a/4aea276feb4550dd9b35ea5b0741ffd5f69e2fba.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/004/949/avatar/original/1538672118-CBD_Relieve.png,,CBD Relieve,0,0,cbd-relive,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/cbd-relive,,,,,,,,,,,,
4351,"CBD Spain is a three-person company in the heart of Andalusia. Mid 2015, Yvonne and Peter settled down in the south of Spain and created CBD Spain. They started immediately with plowing the fields and sowing industrial hemp, putting in an irrigation system along the way to give the plants a comfortable home throughout the hot summer. After the harvest, extraction of CBD oil began on a small scale.
 
Just after CBD Spain celebrated her first birthday, Bo joined the team. During the past years, the team had had encounters with the world of medicinal cannabis, which resulted in the company as it stands today.
 
The three of us share the work, and each has our own specialties. Peter has years of experience in gardening and manages the laboratory, Yvonne does logistics and administration, and Bo does research and product development. Together we stand stronger and are able to supply our customers with a proper explanation of how we work. We can also help clarify some things about medicinal cannabis, CBD oil, and the way it might help in treating illnesses.
 
Our strength lies for a big part in the fact that we do everything ourselves – from seed to bottle – which gives us full control over the entire process. This way we can guarantee the quality, and we stand closer to the product we offer. We believe that craftsmanship is a key component in creating the best possible product.
 
Our hemp plants grow outdoors in the full Spanish sun and native soil. We grow them just for the flowers, so the plant material we use is not a by-product of growing for fiber or seeds. The best ingredients give the best results. We don’t just grow organically, but also use specific bacteria and fungi to nurture soil life and increase soil activity. These added compounds attract bugs that work synergistically with the plant, making it more resistant to pests. This circle of life makes the plant absorb essential nutrients quicker and more efficient, giving strong and healthy plants.
 
At low temperatures and with a special solvent, we collect the precious compounds from the plant material. A very important goal for us is making a so-called ‘full spectrum oil’, which contains a wide range of active compounds such as cannabinoids and terpenes. When we extract, we take the time to repeatedly ‘wash’ the material to get out every last bit, obtaining a concentrate with almost the exact same composition as is found in the original plant.
 
A lot of the CBD oils on the market today are recomposed from CBD crystals. Valuable and essential co-cannabinoids and terpenes are lost, which is unfortunate. Several studies have shown that the effectivity and efficiency of an oil improve dramatically once these extra compounds are there, even in low doses. This phenomenon is known as the ‘entourage effect‘.
 
We are continually working on improving and streamlining our operation. This year we’ve carefully planned out the growing season to get the best yield possible, and we’ve expanded our processing facilities with new equipment to increase efficiency.
 
Recently we’ve switched to a new kind of bottle for the oils, which is a lot easier and cleaner to use. We also offer the possibility to vaporize CBD with a specially designed electronic cigarette. This is a small gadget that is filled with an ‘e-liquid’ that contains CBD. An ideal product for lung patients, among others. Again, all these products we develop and produce ourselves.",,27,00/0085fd9f5413e092cf401717cacf4d624d507016.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/004/351/avatar/original/1523974126-logo.jpg,,CBD Spain,0,0,cbd-spain,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/cbd-spain,,,,,,,,,,,,
3145,"CBD Seeds nació con el objetivo de ofrecer las variedades clásicas en versión original. Después de conocer a profesionales con amplia experiencia en el sector de la crianza o breeding de todo el mundo, conseguimos semillas feminizadas de variedades y cruces de primera calidad. Decidimos empezar un proyecto nuevo, incorporando técnicos, diseñadores gráficos y webmasters a nuestro equipo. El objetivo es convertirnos en un banco de referencia, por lo que respecta a la calidad del producto, al diseño del mismo y al servicio técnico y post venta.
La primera parte de nuestro trabajo fue conseguir una línea de genéticas clásicas. Hemos tenido acceso a las primeras genéticas, aquellas que hicieron leyenda años atrás. Hemos empaquetado aquellos fenotipos que expresan de forma inequívoca el carácter de estas variedades. Si eres un entusiasta de los sabores y los aromas de la vieja escuela, prepárate para un encuentro excepcional y déjate embriagar por estas joyas únicas.
 
Una vez desarrollada la línea clásica, el siguiente paso estaba claro. Al analizar la situación del sector a nivel europeo, constatamos la fuerte demanda de variedades autoflorecientes. Con lo cual decidimos llevar a cabo la árdua tarea conseguir todas nuestras variedades en versión automática, buscando en distintos puntos geógráficos. Conseguimos una línea de automáticas totalmente revolucionaria, puesto que hasta ese momento ningún banco había conseguido ofrecer variedades tan especiales. Estamos muy orgullosos de nuestra colección autofloreciente, así como también nuestros clientes, que nos dan ánimos para continuar con esta tarea, que aunque laboriosa, se ve recompensada al ver el resultado final.
 
En CBD Seeds, todas las semillas pasan un exhaustivo control de calidad antes de ser envasadas en las probetas. Los envases cuentan con un tapón-junta que impide la entrada de la humedad ambiental. Se descartan aquellas semillas inmaduras (con colores grisáceos) y aquellas sin atigrado (cubierta exterior). Estos requisitos son imprescindibles para ofrecer un producto de primera calidad. Recordamos a todos los amigos y clientes que son semillas dedicadas al coleccionismo, por queda prohibida su germinacion.

CBD Wellness stands out in quality and consistency. Their CBD tinctures are specially formulated to guarantee no less than 60% CBD and 40% terpenes. Through a proprietary blend of cannabinoids and terpenes that work synergistically, CBD Wellness creates premium CBD-rich medical cannabis products.
 
 
 
History
 
Matthew Scott is the founder of CBD Wellness and began this cannabusiness to bring holistic aid to people in need. He was driven to create this brand after the loss of three family members through the failure of traditional, western health care. Matthew’s vision was to provide the best quality and most effective holistic alternatives to prevent others from experiencing what he and many other patients and families had. Today, CBD Wellness accomplishes Matthew’s mission with their line of CBD-rich tinctures and topicals that give patients access to a safe, reliable alternative to pain management.
 
 
 
Process
 
Cannabinoids and terpenes are two botanical compounds that provide medicinal benefits. CBD Wellness combines the two to create a line of marijuana products that deliver holistic relief. A proper formula is the key to making an effective CBD-rich oil. CBD Wellness has formulated these products to activate quickly for fast relief and absorb into the system at maximum bio-availability.
 
 
 
CBD Wellness employs a CO2-extraction method to create their products - the safest method for extracting botanical concentrates. Through manipulating pressure and temperature, the CBD Wellness lab technicians are able to expertly formulate their tinctures and topicals. This approach results in pure cannabis oil that requires little to no post processing and preserves the helpful, natural compounds that provide relief.
 
 
 
Products
 
CBD Wellness offers their CBD-Rich 1-oz Tincture in three levels of potency; 200 mg, 500 mg, and 1,000mg. Their tinctures are hemp-derived and completely solvent free, crafted with a blend of full terpenes and cannabinoids for optimal health benefits.

795,"When you hear the name Tommy Chong you immediately think of Cannabis. As one-half of the legendary comedy duo Cheech & Chong he helped pioneer a completely unique brand of comedy directed at the counter-culture movement of the early 70’s. The pair came to define a generation of young entertainers and single-handedly launched the genre of Stoner Comedy. And at the heart of this brand of entertainment was, of course, cannabis. On screen and off Tommy became a vocal advocate for his favorite herb. In a time where cannabis had to be talked about in whispers, Tommy was a loud voice for the advocacy movement, working tirelessly to destigmatize the use of this healing plant. Now that society has moved in a more positive direction regarding the medicinal and recreational use of cannabis, Tommy’s voice continues to ring out loudly, touting its benefits and place in society. His message has never changed, and his passion has remained as strong as it was on stage many years ago. Now Tommy is thrilled to share that passion and knowledge of cannabis with the rest of the world. Using his lifelong connections in the industry, he has made it his personal mission to share the very best product available with his fans and fellow herb connoisseurs. If anyone knows weed, its Tommy. And now fans of comedy and cannabis alike can experience the strains and products that Tommy himself has hand selected.

What makes Classic Roots different? 

 

Quality Genetics 

It starts with genetics. Our team is on the never-ending pursuit for the most unique and elite strains out there. Our genetics have been highly curated and selected based on terpene profiles, flavor, and potency so that you have a premium experience every time. 

 

Unique Terpenes 

It’s all about the terps, baby! Our trailblazing standards always include testing for terpenes so that you can find the strain that is best suited to you. Our terpene percentages are some of the highest in the industry with over 4% terpenes in some of our flower and as high as 10% terpenes in our concentrates. 

 

Lovingly Grown 

Trust us, growing with love really works! Our plants are given extra special care and attention in our state-of-the-art facility from seed through harvest and beyond. Each rooms’ environment is carefully monitored day and night to ensure our plants are comfortable at all times. 

 

Hand Trimmed & Packaged with Care 

Quality over everything else, that’s why we chose to hand trim all of our flower. Each bud is handled with care to ensure you receive the highest quality flower every time. After getting a trim, our buds are placed into environmentally controlled bins that are monitored for temperature and moisture until they are packaged up and ready for you to enjoy. With our high standards in place, your flower will remain as fresh as the day it was harvested. 

 

Small Green Footprint 

It’s no surprise that growing and processing cannabis requires lots of energy and environmental resources. At Classic Roots, we are dedicated to decreasing our environmental footprint through energy usage, resources, and even our packaging. We’ll look out for Mother Earth while you enjoy a green lifestyle. 

 

Passion 

We’ve been in the game for some time now and cannabis is our number one passion. From the moment you open up a Classic Roots product, you will be able to feel the love and attention put into every gram. 

 

Alright Michigan, what are you waiting for? Go grab yourself some Classic Roots and see the magic we have in store for you

Pure.Pristine.Clean. Step into the Claw experience and let us dissolve your symptoms with one puff and many flavors. Take a seat, pull out your pen and relax. We've got you covered. Claw is State Licensed, so there’s no need to worry.
 
Every idea starts with a problem to be solved. Claw was founded searching for severe chronic pain relief and evolved with an immune compromised sensitivity to pesticides. Leading the industry into Michigan's clean medicine movement and now state mandated testing. 
 
Claw came to solve the health-conscious patients concerns when the market still had a monopoly board of nylon wicked, plastic, untested, unregulated, no name cartridges. Our solution was a glass & ceramic core ""sauce"" cartridge. No games, no questions and always lab tested. Knowing the source was our start to clean medicine.
 
Claw evolved into distillate filled cartridges, raising THC levels and added cannabis derived terpenes. This provided the most effective and quickest pain relief in a discrete form. Claw has never used MCT, VG, PG or other cutting agents. Our ingredients are crafted with everyone's health & wellness in mind. Do you buy your groceries without knowing what is in them? We don't either! 
 
We currently produce 510 thread cartridges featuring the highest quality state lab tested THC distillate and cannabis derived terpene blends. In 2018 we introduced Michigan's original pod, the vFire. Claw has exclusive distribution rights in our home state of Michigan for the vFire. The future of Claw will widen your variety of intake methods and shorten activation time to help increase your times of relief.

History
 
Clones Clone Gardens was founded in 2015 by a really awesome person dedicated to empowering patients through sustainable medicine. “Anything that can get people away from pharmaceuticals just makes a lot of sense,” Tyler, founder of Clones Clone Gardens, explains. Prior to launching his cannabusiness, Tyler was a patient and card holder himself. He was inspired to start Clones Clone Gardens simply because he “thought it’d be cool.” Tyler’s vision was to create a cannabis clone business that shrugs the shady dealer mentality of old for coolness, compassion, and education. Tyler’s mission was well received, and through word of mouth Clones Clone Gardens grew substantially. Today, Clones Clone Gardens still serves the same community with hopes to grow into other areas throughout Southern California.
 
 
 
Process
 
If you're growing your first cannabis plant, there is a good chance of it dying. Clones Clone Gardens is dedicated to being a resource for wellness and will replace plants that die within the first five days. Clones Clone Gardens holds the foundational threads of cannabis culture dear. The 420 community was established on a premise of compassion, which is why Clones Clone Gardens happy to replace clones for patients and provide phenomenal customer service. New patients growing cannabis for the first time will leave Clones Clone Garden with a wealth of knowledge and comprehensive support.

We’ve done it by diving deep into science and craft, developing, testing and fine-tuning 1000s of samples and 100s of possible versions. Formulated by our expert research team, our curated blends are tailor-made to ease you into the mood you crave. And they do it in a proprietary precision-rolled form called Leaflettes. Savor discretely when you want, how you want. With us, the choice is yours.

We use only 100% pure cannabis with no fillers, additives or pesticides, ever. We partner with sustainable growers in the far reaches of Northern California who care for their crops with integrity and expertise.
 
Blends Crafted to Perfection
 
Instead of relying on a single cannabis strain, we curate our custom blends with precision — carefully balancing terpene profiles and cannabinoid content to gently deliver the elevated, yet mindful effect you want.
 
Precision-Rolled Consistency
 
We make our filtered Leaflettes with a proprietary technology that ensures uniformity across the board, from packing density to smoldering rates. That means, you can count on a consistent — and consistently great — experience every time.
 
Remarkably Smooth Draw
 
Our proprietary filters increase airflow for a dramatically smooth and easy draw. They also remove potentially harmful solids like tar. And no worries, they’re nothing like regular cigarette filters. They enhance the experience, not detract from it.
 
 
 
Get moving, get thinking, and get going.

About Cobra Extracts:
Cobra Extracts oil is gently coaxed from family farmed cannabis crops. We never use any harmful solvents and we purify the oil using our innovative cold refining process. This allows us to produce exceptionally potent CO2 oil that is crystal clear, glows a beautiful amber color, and drips like honey. Unlike some other companies, we never add any additives or ""cut"" our oil with anything. All Natural. Pure and Simple.
 
Cobra Extracts' Unique Process:
All of our products are manufactured in a professional laboratory setting. Cobra Extracts spent 6 months working with a PhD chemist from Cal Tech to help create a revolutionary ""cold"" refining process. We maintain strict quality control procedures during each step of our process. All our products are independently tested and test results are printed on each product. All our materials are sourced from family farmers that never use pesticides, which allows us to deliver the highest quality product to our patients. We use a revolutionary ""cold"" refining process that creates a cannabis oil that has a naturally high terpene level, giving it a smooth taste and aroma that has a balanced essence of flavor and cannabinoids straight from the flower. 
 
The Cobra Name:
King Cobra venom is one of the most potent poisons in nature. It’s a glowing amber liquid that drips like honey as it’s coaxed from the fangs of a King Cobra. Its power is both feared and highly sought after throughout the world. King Cobras are independent hunters who sit atop their ecosystem. Few animals can escape from their speed, agility, or the potency of their venom.

History
 
The founder of Blue Bear Cannafarm jumped into the cannabis industry at the start of legalization. She was determined to do more than just start a cannabusiness, she wanted to do it right. She established a premium organic grow and made a point to stay in tune with the community, learning the wants and needs of fellow Alaskans that love marijuana. Her due-diligence paid off, providing a head-start in compliance. She steadily marched her brand forward and after all was in perfect order she was ready to reveal her menu of top-shelf cannabis.
 
 
 
Blue Bear Cannafarm launched on 4/20 of 2016.
 
 
 
Process
 
All Blue Bear Cannafarm flowers grow in a special blend of nutrients formulated to nurture the plants to the fullest. The environment is entirely pesticide free and flowers trimmed by hand. Once those buds reach their optimal potential, the buds are harvested and dried, rendering smooth burning flowers with incredible flavor and potency.

2521,"“The Gold Standard in Full-Spectrum Extraction”
 
BOSM Labs is the specialist of whole-plant cannabis extracts, producing saucy and sugary full spectrum concentrates. BOSM Labs' passion for marijuana stands at the core of what they do, and their artisan extractors are driven by their love of cannabis. BOSM Labs has set out to craft the best Live Resin extracts in Colorado, working with local grows and collectives to source their starting material. Seasoned patients and concentrate enthusiasts will see the difference as soon as they open up a container of BOSM Labs.
 
 
 
History
 
The founder had been part of the marijuana industry since 2009 and was lead by the desire to put out the highest quality product which lead to the development of this premium concentrates company.
 
BOSM Labs began in February 2017, but had their official launch in April. This Live Resin extraction cannabusiness was conceptualized at an unusual venue. BOSM Labs was created at what the founders now refer to as an ""X-Games development meeting."" At the 2017 X-Games the founders took a whiteboard to their hotel to ideate BOSM Labs’ brand vision. They knew they wanted the focus to center on Live Resin extraction, but were driven by their own ability to create concentrates unlike anyone else on the market.
 
 
 
Process
 
BOSM Labs employs a five-point terpene protection plan that begins at harvest and goes throughout the extraction process. Great flowers have great terpenes, and BOSM Labs prides themselves on having an eye for premium cannabis. BOSM Labs connects with cannabis farms operated by experienced and dedicated cultivators with the same amount of passion for marijuana. By sourcing their starting material from other impassioned cannabis enthusiasts BOSM Labs begins their extraction with flowers of the highest quality. BOSM Labs is a resource to premium cannabis extracts for individual customers and dispensaries looking for solutions to their processing needs.
 
 
 
Products
 
BOSM Labs is for those who long for flavor. Remarkable terpenes are expressed in every glob, whether a baby-dab or “extra-medium” sized dab for after work, every note that was in the original plant sings with flavor. Their line of Whole Plant extractions are their sauciest, and their Trim Resin also displays chunks of sugar with the occasional budder consistency. No matter what patients choose they are sure to receive a flavorful dab with clean, euphoric effects.
 
Their most coveted extraction is BOSM Labs Gold Live Resin, made with top-shelf flowers. This concentrate is made to pack full bodied taste, and their terpene protection plan ensures the flavor profile of the original plant is significantly apparent. Their other cannabis extractions are not strain specific, BOSM Labs also offers terpene forward concentrates as Cured Live Resin, Live Resin and Trim Resin.",,115,30/307e9a5e96106154e8c88bbe7e7c6903a729b5dd.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/521/avatar/original/bosm-labs_logo.jpg,,BOSM Labs,4.16666650772095,4,bosm-labs,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/bosm-labs,,,,,,,,,,,,

2106,"THC isn’t the whole story.
 
The many benefits we get from cannabis stem from hundreds of natural compounds that make each strain unique. THC is just one part of the story. Judging cannabis by THC alone doesn’t take into account these other compounds that interact with THC to heighten the effects we feel. We never chase one-dimensional, artificially high THC levels because we believe cannabis works best when it includes all of the other naturally occurring compounds that together produce an “entourage effect.”
 
 
 
Who are we?
 
Since 2014 BRITE has crafted premium full-spectrum cannabis concentrates utilizing our proprietary CO2 extraction process, run in small batches in Oakland, CA. Our strain-specific concentrates replicate the unique profile of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavinoids in each variety of cannabis by gently preserving them in the final product.
 
 
 
We always start with the finest botanicals sourced from the highest quality cultivators throughout Northern California. We never introduce any industrially-derived terpenes, flavors, or additives of any kind. Each batch of extract takes nearly three weeks to craft from beginning-to-end, because quality takes time, and we believe that purity matters. We believe our process results in a more aromatic product that honors the cannabis plant’s diversity and produces superior effects.
 
 
 
We believe in the PLANT
 
We believe in PEOPLE
 
We believe in PROCESS
 
We believe in PROGRESS

Cuidando por encima de todo la calidad y no la cantidad Buddha Seeds se ha convertido en muy poco tiempo en un referente a nivel mundial.
 
Cada una de nuestras variedades está trabajada con gran esfuerzo y dedicación, para ofrecer un resultado distinto e innovador, capaz de satisfacer las necesidades del cultivador más exigente.
 
En Buddha Seeds buscamos variedades concretas para la creación de los cruces, con características especiales de cada una de éstas intentando fijar de una generación a otra la frecuencia de genes que tengan las mejores expresiones fenotípicas.
 
 
 
Buddha Seeds emplea técnicas punteras para conseguir los mejores resultados. Para ello, no escatimamos esfuerzos y trabajamos con un grupo cualificado integrado por agrónomos de la Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, al igual que por biólogos que llevan a cabo tareas de Investigación y Desarrollo que nos ha permitido situarnos gracias a nuestras avanzadas tecnologías como referente del sector.
 
 
 
Desarrollamos variedades para ofrecerte los mejores fenotipos del mercado, es por eso que somos cada vez más apreciados por el público en general y solicitados por otros bancos para colaborar en el desarrollo de sus variedades.
 
 
 
 
 
En Buddha Seeds hemos desarrollado una metodología que nos permite caracterizar los genes que codifican las enzimas responsables en la síntesis de cannabinoides.
 
Gracias a estas tecnologías podemos analizar el genoma de plántulas recién sembradas y prever el perfil de cannabinoides que sintetizarán en estado adulto.
 
Esto supone una gran ventaja para el programa de mejora que estamos llevando a cabo, en el que escogemos el quimiotipo de nuestras variedades comerciales de cannabis.
 
Empleamos técnicas punteras como son: la selección asistida por marcadores genéticos moleculares, el análisis de cannabinoides y terpenos mediante cromatografía de gases con detector de ionización de llama, la propagación y mantenimiento de genéticas in vitro, la creación y caracterización de individuos poliploides, con el objeto de conseguir individuos con un gran vigor vegetativo y un elevado nivel de cannabinoides.",,39,c9/c9f011b361b28b9ea99cfcc8bd4ef3964361d3c3.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/507/avatar/original/1508761818-logo.jpg,,Buddha Seeds,0,0,buddha-seeds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/buddha-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,

History
 
Cannabis just makes sense to the founder of Cali Premiere Extracts When he realized the tremendous benefits that medical marijuana could deliver he couldn’t understand why this astounding plant wasn’t available to everyone. He entered a period of research and development and found that solventless cannabis extraction was the best option for cannabis concentrates. Thus began Cali Premiere Extracts an extraction company dedicated to crafting healthy marijuana concentrates.
 
 
 
Process
 
Cali Premiere Extracts believes that marijuana is amazing on its own and nothing to as little as possible needs to be done to it. From soil to oil, Cali Premiere Extracts oversees quality control every step of the way. They source their genetics from local clone masters that provide unique and exotic strain varieties. Their cultivation is organic, growing their marijuana flowers in the strain’s most ideal conditions. Once their yield of resinous nug run flowers are harvested, the extraction begins. Cali Premiere Extracts is truly solventless, and there is no use of CO2 in their methods. They create incredible cannabis extracts with five main factors: heat, pressure, water, ice and perfect timing. Crafting the best cannabis extracts takes a lot of time, and their extraction artists have acquired the skills to know how to press flowers to perfection.

History
 
Sam entered the cannabis industry in 2009 after a career in finance. He lived and worked in Walnut Creek, California as a glass distributor, networking with smoke shops throughout Northern California and beyond. After successfully operating his distribution company he felt it was time to embark on a new journey with hemp-derived products.
 
 
 
Sam’s first few months in hemp were met with skepticism: his attempts to educate people about the helpful properties of cannabidiol often fell on the deaf ears of those unwilling to hear him out. Sam persisted, for CBD was too beneficial to be ignored. He worked with some of the best physicians to study the interaction of CBD within the endocannabinoid system, and how to isolate it for maximum effectiveness. As Cali Born Dreams' brand development continued the good news of CBD spread throughout the cannabis community. Soon many more folks were open to cannabidiol as an alternative medicine, and in 2015 Sam launched Cali Born Dreams.
 
 
 
Process
 
Cali Born Dreams is proud to be a pioneer in CBD. The team begins with USDA Certified, organic hemp flowers cultivated in Colorado for extraction. Then those buds undergo proprietary extraction methods, resulting in full-spectrum CBD isolate.

Mission:
 
The California Dreamin’ team started brewing delectable sparkling juices in early 2017 when the founders noticed that most of their friends were intimidated by the potency of current edible products on the market. The founders knew that while Southern California is incredibly lucky to be the epicenter of the best flower, concentrates, and edibles in the world, many patients wanted a lighter experience or simply had a low tolerance for cannabinoids. The team put their collective heads together, and decided to craft a cannabis-infused product that embodied everything about their beloved Golden State. Thus, California Dreamin’ was born, ready to refresh customers and offer delicious, reliably dosed juices for its patients.
 
 
 
Products:
 
California Dreamin’ delivers experiences that patients with any level of tolerance can enjoy. Sparkling juices are a fun, healthy, and refreshing way to enjoy cannabis without smoke or added sugar. To craft their beverages, California Dreamin’ beverage makers carefully blend cannabis tincture using their proprietary process, which guarantees accurate and consistent dosing.

3502,"“Pure. Hemp”

 

Canna Hemp combines the power of CBD and cannabis-derived terpenes to deliver best-in-class holistic wellness. Every one of their products is thoughtfully crafted to ensure their superior hemp-based oils have the perfect blend of high-quality botanical ingredients. Each item on their menu features organically derived cannabidiol, free of THC.

 

History

The Canna Hemp journey began with a belief in natural healing. The founders have been part of the industry since 2013 with a mission to provide safer alternative treatments with natural products. They were disheartened by the medical industry's focus on pharmaceutical medications that often seemed to only treat symptoms. They began to seek out natural remedies that address the entire body without the side effects that come from mainstream medicine. They discovered the synergistic power of cannabidiol combined with terpenes and were inspired to share the incredible benefits hemp can provide. Canna Hemp officially launched in July 2017 and has happily served the community of Nevada ever since.

 

Process

Safety and purity are paramount to the Canna Hemp team, and each step is designed to ensure the most quality in every product. They begin with 100% legal hemp flower that is entirely free of THC. Those flowers are processed with CO2 extraction to create pure CBD oils. Most of their CBD products are re-introduced to all natural, cannabis-derived terpenes that provide effects to address specific ailments. Canna Hemp Elixirs are processed with their state-of-the-art nanoparticle technology, resulting in maximum bioavailability. The all natural goodness doesn’t stop there. Canna Hemp utilizes premium ingredients to create their topicals and lotions, free of petroleum and parabens.

 

Products

Soak

Canna Hemp delivers a line of hemp-based products that nurture wellness and nourish the body inside and out. Their CBD Body Lotions combine the benefits of cannabidiol, hemp seed oil, and coconut oil in a lightweight lotion that delivers penetrating moisturization without leaving a greasy surface layer. Try any of their beautifully fragrant options like Citrus Blossom, Harlot Haze, Hyd-Rose, and Kind Cucumber. Canna Hemp also offers their CBD Body Lotion in Free & Clear, a fragrance- and colorant-free lotion safe for sensitive skin types. Get kissably soft lips and absorb the benefits of cannabidiol with Canna Hemp’s deliciously flavored CBD Lip Balms. To treat aches, bruises, and other skin afflictions apply Canna Hemp’s powerful Pain Relief Cream.

 

Eat

Enhance your life with a Canna Hemp Elixir -- CBD- and terpene-filled tinctures in blends for every aspect of life including Calm, Euphoria, Focus, Relief, and Sleep. Don’t forget about your furry, four-legged friends! Pets in pain can find relief through Canna Hemp, too, thanks to their CBD Pet Tincture.

 

Smoke

Canna Hemp offers CBD Dabs, a line of CO2-extracted concentrates that can be smoked in a wax vaporizer or dab rig. Try Dabs Pure for isolated CBD cannabinoids or try out their cannabis-derived, flavorful Diamond OG and Tangerine Dream. Take holistic wellness on the go with Canna Hemp’s vape cartridges filled with cannabidiol rich oils in Tangerine Dream and Diamond OG as well as options for specific effects including; Calm, Euphoria, Focus, Relief, and Sleep.

 

Lab Testing

Canna Hemp is pleased to offer hemp products lab tested by DB Labs, LLC. Their products are examined for pesticides, microbials, mycotoxins, heavy metals, terpene profiles, cannabinoid profiles, and for any detectable THC.",mycannahemp,2492,3b/3bab208db4183692907e76b573a35d8df8346bc5.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/502/avatar/original/1508718056-Canna_Hemp_Logo.jpg,mycannahemp,Canna Hemp,4.62658214569092,28,canna-hemp,mycannahemp,https://weedmaps.com/brands/canna-hemp,https://cannahemp.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

3909,"“Planting the seeds of health & wellness.”
 
 
 
The compassionate and dedicated team at Cannabidiol Life is committed to sharing comprehensive information and research conducted on CBD. They strive to change the negative perception surrounding hemp and hemp products and believe that change will only occur with proper education.
 
 
 
Cannabidiol Life produces cannabis products of incredible quality. Each edible is crafted with entirely organic ingredients and expresses the full spectrum of characteristics derived from single-sourced, premium hemp flowers. Thanks to a dedicated team of professionals, Cannabidiol Life is the one-stop learn-and-shop for folks in need of organic, non-intoxicating relief.
 
 
 
History
 
For a long time, Christopher worked with patients with cancer and mesothelioma. At the time cannabidiol benefits were not widely publicized, and Christopher longed to find a better alternative for patients with terminal illness and chronic pain. As scientific studies were published, he read about the benefits of cannabis and became intrigued. He would forward that research to the patients he worked with, in hopes that cannabis could help. Medicinal cannabis lingered in the back of his mind, and he held out the hope of discovering a way to improve the quality of life for those around him.
 
 
 
When he stumbled upon CBD, he was emphatic. Christopher began to research all there is to know about hemp and its predominant and fascinating cannabinoid, CBD. He noticed the claims were scattered. One page would site CBD’s pain-relieving benefits while another would note its anti-inflammatory effects, but there wasn’t a place for comprehensive information about the plant. He felt ought to change that and created Cannabidiol Life, a website filled with CBD information.
 
 
 
After successfully building a source for education and knowledge, Christopher was ready to get into creating CBD products himself. He assembled a team of the best minds and connected with Colorado farmers to source the finest hemp flowers. The result was brand that provides a unique level of support, and the first Cannabidiol Life products sold in October 2017.
 
 
 
Process
 
The extraction artists of Cannabidiol Life execute premiere techniques to craft their CBD oils. Through the slow and challenging process of hemp cradling in 100% organic ethanol, Cannabidiol Life yields incredible concentrate. First, hemp flowers are submerged in food-grade ethanol and brought to a very low boil. While the flowers are being boiled at low-heat the plant is “cradled,” meaning the molecules locked inside the trichomes are lightly rocked back and forth. This natural friction produces just enough molecular movement to create a vapor containing all of the desirable characteristics of the hemp plant. That vapor is converted back into a liquid, then blended into Cannabidiol Life products.
 
 
 
Products
 
Not only a source for CBD info, Cannabidiol Life offers a large selection including oils, edibles, capsules, concentrates, topicals, and pet products.
 
 
 
Cannabidiol Life’s CBD Oils come in several convenient options like 50 mg CBD Oil Shots or a CBD Oil Disposable Vape Pen. Cannabidiol Life Oil tinctures come in four different potencies to meet the anyone’s needs from chronic, severe pain to mild discomfort.
 
 
 
Users can eat or drink their way to wellness with Cannabidiol Life’s CBD-infused chocolate bites and bars, caramels, and gummies. Plus, their CBD Life Water is the perfect way to hydrate and receive your daily cannabinoids. Another smoke-free option is their CBD Capsules. These caps are available in a 1-Week Sample size including seven capsules packing 25 mg of CBD in each, as well as bottles with 350, 750, 1,500 mg of CBD. 
 
 
 
Cannabidiol Life has dabs on deck. People can enjoy a dab of delicious, terpene-filled CBD wax, isolate, and crystals without experiencing a head-change.
 
 
 
Cannabidiol Life’s line of hemp-derived skincare, Pure Kind Botanicals, is a fantastic way to get relief, too. The Pure Kind Botanicals line includes facial serum, lemongrass body butter, and a soothing balm for rapid topical pain relief. Provide holistic care for your pup or kitty with a pet tincture.

4646,"CannaBioDerm produziert seit 2017 hochwertige, natürliche Hanfkosmetik, mit Cannabidiol (CBD) angereichert. 
 
Einer der Gründer leidet seit seiner Kindheit an Neurodermitis. Lediglich Kortison verschaffte ihm ein Leben lang Linderung. Bis er erfuhr, dass CBD doppelt so entzündungshemmend sei wie Kortison. Also versuchte er eine CBD-haltige Salbe und er musste nie wieder auf das Kortison zurückgreifen. In einem Gespräch mit den anderen Gründern reifte dann der Plan, für Fälle wie seine auch eine Tageskosmetik zu entwickeln, die gleichzeitig angenehm riecht und die herausragenden Eigenschaften von kaltgepresstem Hanfsamenöl und Cannabidiol vereint. 
 
Entwickelt hat sich daraus inzwischen eine Serie für verschiedenste Anwendungen: Eine Salbe für akut gereizte oder offene Hautpartien, aber auch eine Gesichtslotion, eine Shavelotion, ein Tattoobalsam, Badebomben, eine Bodylotion und Handcreme gehören mittlerweile zum Repertoire. Und die Ideenschmiede ist noch lange nicht am Ende. Viele weitere Produkte sind in der Forschung oder aktuell erschienen. Im Jahr 2018 kam zum Beispiel ein Bartöl und ein Haaröl zu dem schon vorher beliebten Massageöl, eine Zahnpasta ist in der Entwicklung, ebenso werden verschiedene Waschlotionen und Seifen erforscht. Im April 2018 gewann CannaBioDerm in Zürich den CannAward in der Kategorie ""Natural Resources"" - das ist wohl auch dem Fakt geschuldet, dass CBDerm auf 100% natürliche Inhaltsstoffe großen Wert legt.

With our country in the midst of an opioid epidemic – which claims more than 115 lives each day in the United States – Cannafornia is on the frontlines of helping bring awareness to the benefits and healing properties of this God-given plant; in hopes that more people will put down the pills and pick up the plant.

All of our strains are tested for quality and potency to ensure access to a safeand consistent product.

He was there to watch his son play baseball, which was the same time Seattle’s first recreational dispensary opened. Bryant went to the newly opened shop, entering the chaos of an eager cannabis community longing to get their hands on legal product. That dispensary quickly ran out of product, and Bryant foresaw similar issues with Alaska’s cannabis market.He went home and began working on drafting legislation.
 
 
 
Bryant has been part of the cannabis industry since voter approval in 2014, but meeting every requirement for the city of Anchorage took a few years. Arctic Herbery was the first cannabis brand in Anchorage, and it took Bryant’s unwavering patience and diplomacy to work with their assembly members to get his cannabusiness opened. Arctic Herbery officially launched in 2016, and has gladly served the community of Anchorage ever since.
 
 
 
Process
 
Their selection of cannabis includes a menu of high-quality, hand-trimmed flowers from their in-house cultivation. Arctic Herbery operates their cannabis farms to ensure consistent runs, allowing Anchorage customers to rely on their flowers for the same effects, flavor, and potency every time. Their genetics are partly sourced from reputable seed banks such as Sensi Seeds, while others are strains Bryant developed.
 
 
 
Products
 
Anchorage loves Arctic Herbery’s premium flowers, a favorite being their Sergeant Pepper strain, developed in-house. The cannabis community can’t get enough of their Laughing Buddha flowers, either. Laughing Buddha is a Sativa-dominant strain with a sweet flavor profile bursting with notes of lemon and pineapple. Other beloved buds include Afghani, a pure Indica landrace strain that boasts pungent, floral aromatics. The flavor profile is spicy, and the effects wash over users with a sleep-inducing body high. No matter what strain of flowers you bring home, Arctic Herbery is sure to deliver the highest quality cannabis in Anchorage.

El cultivo de las plantas es totalmente biológico. Por eso quiero deciros que todos aquellos que ya habeís confiado y los que en un futuro lo hareís, que teneís en la mano un producto genético de primera calidad. La gran diferencia entre este banco y otros es que las semillas se hacen bajo el sol y la luna al aire libre sin invernaderos.
 
Si algo caracteriza las variedades de Asturjaya es la fortaleza y la rapidez con que crecen y florecen sus variedades.Tras 27 años de cultivo y selección genética de paises productores el resultado son unas variedades con una alta resistencia en plagas y enfermedades, con periodos de floración muy cortos en comparacion con las variedades comerciales.
 
Las condiciones de cultivo en Asturias son duras, esto acompañado de otoños lluviosos nos han hecho seleccionar los paretales utilizados para cruzar los mas fuertes y rápidos. Sólo esperamos que estas preciosas joyas que teneis entre las manos las trateís con amor y respeto, y ellas os devolveran los cuidados con una cosecha de aromas, sabores, y efectos totalmente sorprendentes.

Our Story 
 
Azuca Technology was invented by Ron Silver, the chef behind Bubby’s—NYC’s favorite brunch spots. Having crafted perfect mayonnaise, vinaigrette and hollandaise for decades, Ron knows a lot—maybe more than anyone—about the art and science of emulsion, aka mixing things that aren’t mutually soluble, like oil and water. When Ron discovered that the drawbacks of hemp extracts are tied to its oil-based delivery system, he saw a path to replacing slow-acting, strange-tasting, unpredictable conventional hemp extracts, with a precise, fast-acting and delicious alternative: Azuca.
 
 
 
Ron founded Azuca Labs to do what nobody had done before—blend the best ideas from scientific and culinary sources. Azuca Labs pioneered a new process that transforms cannabinoid delivery, eliminating the need for an oil-based carrier. With three patents pending, Azuca Technology helps your body absorb hemp extract faster, by getting the oil out. This allows Azuca products to take effect in a groundbreaking two to fifteen minutes.
 
 
 
Water-friendly Azuca also tastes a lot better. Unlike products using oil-based carriers, you can mix Azuca sweeteners directly into any drink or recipe without adding an oily texture, or strong taste and smell, like other hemp extracts. You can also enjoy the wellness benefits of hemp cannabinoids in Azuca Chocolate Coins, artisan-crafted for a premium experience. From flavor to packaging to precise dosing and predictable experience, at Azuca Labs, we’re committed to creating the ideal edibles experience for everyone—precise, fast-acting and delicious.",,56,9f/9f22f717c6a956cbe25ef4d97ae5df7a66fcfcb1.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/005/175/avatar/original/1551381105-Azuca.jpg,,Azuca,5,0,azuca,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/azuca,,,,,,,,,,,,

3929,"“A healthy pet is a happy pet.”
 
 
 
Bailey’s CBD crafts high-quality CBD-infused pet products to provide your furry friends a complete and balanced diet.
 
 
 
Bailey’s CBD isn’t just for pets in chronic pain — it’s a great way to give your four-legged companion a boost of wellness. With Baliey’s CBD, you can help your pets live healthily and age with grace. All mammals have an endocannabinoid system, with receptors designed to process cannabinoids. Bailey’s CBD taps into those natural receptors to promote a better quality of life and more wagging tails.
 
 
 
History
 
Jay and Bailey have a special bond. Jay wanted to provide complete care for his pup, Bailey, and decided to converge his experience in cannabis with his love for animals.
 
 
 
For five years, Jay worked at a medical cannabis dispensary in North San Diego. The shop cultivated their own CBD rich plants and created CBD tinctures and Rick Simpson Oil for their terminally ill patrons. During that time, Jay was educated on how cannabidiol interacts with the body. Eventually, he opened a delivery service and for three years supplied medicinal cannabis products for folks with cancer and other chronic or debilitating conditions.
 
 
 
One day he decided to formulate a CBD tincture for pets, and began to provide those formulations through his delivery business with the help of his own Veterinarian. This garnered a different clientele — these customers weren’t cannabis users, they just really loved their pets. Jay got overwhelming feedback, and many would report back in tears of joy due to the impact CBD had on the quality of their pets lives.
 
 
 
Jay began to fine-tune the product with meticulous effort. Animal’s endocannabinoid system is different than humans and ensuring there is very little to no THC in his products was vital. People take on cannabinoids in a way that is unique to humans, but animals cannot psychologically process the effects of delta-9 THC. The next thing was achieving full-spectrum raw oil because cannabinoids work more succinctly when terpenes are involved.(Entourage Effect) This process took about 6 months to formulate. Once everything was in place, Jay was ready to launch. In October 2017, Bailey’s CBD was officially incorporated with the adorable face of Jay’s pug Bailey as the logo.
 
 
 
Process
 
Bailey’s CBD oils and products are derived from premium hemp flowers cultivated at Colorado licensed farms. After harvest, those flowers undergo an extraction process to isolate the desired properties locked inside the terpenes of the plant. Once the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes are derived from the flowers, the oil is ready for formulation and is blended into the many products Bailey’s CBD offers today.
 
 
 
Products
 
Bailey’s CBD offers cannabidiol-infused tinctures formulated for house-pets and even horses, plus a 150 mg Beef Flavored CBD Soft Chews for relief that is also a treat. Each tincture includes an easy to use dropper for concise measurement and swift application.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
The oil used in Bailey’s CBD is lab tested by Cannasafe, then post-production is batch tested by SC Labs. The final test includes full panel analysis from cannabinoid and terpene content to harmful contaminants.",,101,2e/2e4eecf7e403093b62ff6deee57011eaec895193.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/929/avatar/original/1600277788-Baileys_Logo_Master_Baileys_Logo_No_Badge.png,,Bailey's CBD,5,2,baileys-cbd,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/baileys-cbd,,,,,,,,,,,,

BAM focuses on boutique-style harvests, which enables them to spend the necessary amount of time on each batch to produce artisan quality cannabis. With “quality over quantity” at the forefront of their cultivation philosophy they achieved 1st place in the 2017 Cannabis Classic for best Hybrid with Key Lime Pie.
 
BAM’s success is largely due to focusing on the health and happiness of each plant. If you listen closely you can hear the sounds of classical music emanating from the grow room. In order to complete the process BAM places emphasis on the importance of curing correctly. They take their time to cure their cannabis slowly to produce buds that look and smell amazing but also burn and smoke smoothly. All this attention to detail and careful processing consistently leads to some of the most beautiful and fragrant cannabis that can be found in the great state of Alaska.",,84,e6/e6fb4bfa6c48e44d27d8c3452e0daf3f39222fe8.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/905/avatar/original/1535402224-BAM_Logo.jpg,,BAM Alaska,5,2,bam-alaska,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/bam-alaska,,,,,,,,,,,,

1714,"“The Highest Standards Didn't Exist, So We Created Them”

/Binsk/

Adjective

An experience of perfection

The quality or state of being elegant

Physical or intellectual pleasure, delight, or ecstasy

Binske is proud to supply their ensemble of world-to-table ingredients, thoughtfully sourced from artisan farms around the globe. A single ambition drives the Binske team: to craft cannabis products with superior taste and quality. With every bite, sip, or hit, Binske cannabis products deliver a sophisticated palette of complex flavor and sensations.

History

The founders of Binske are a team of brothers with an entrepreneurial spirit and moral dedication to excellence. They built their first cannabis farm from the ground up, rather than retrofitting an existing building or warehouse. The Binske brothers wanted to break into the market with cannabis-infused products that would take edibles to the next level. The two began developing culinary centric edibles, with attention to each of their ingredients. After crafting a line of THC infused handmade chocolate bars, they were ready to debut their creation to the world. Binske sold its first chocolate bar in January 2017, and has proudly supplied the cannabis community world-class products since.

Process

Couverture Chocolate

With a background in cannabis cultivation, Binske can truly employ quality control from soil to final product. Everything from Binske is certified Fair-Trade, organic, non-GMO, and preservative-free. Only one product on the menu includes milk, leaving the rest Vegan-friendly. Binske crafts their chocolates with Honduran Oro Maya Cacao, which Mayans believed to contain the spirit of god, and Peruvian Nacional Cocoa -- some of the rarest in the world. Once the beans are harvested and fermented, their chocolates are handmade and tempered with a simple, short list of premium quality ingredients.

Products

Earth

Center yourself and connect with the environment around you with Binske’s line of Terra, or Earth products. Their Peruvian Nacional Cacao contains 68% pure cacao and in a 10-piece chocolate bar that provides 100 mg total cannabinoids. Sweeten your day with Binske’s Yampa Valley Honey, light and clean in flavor with potent, floral aromatics. Binske’s Terra collection also features their Garlic Olive Oil -- there are so many culinary possibilities. Enjoy their Strawberry All Natural Fruit Leather, preservative-free and made with strawberries from an organic garden.

Wind

Find release and step into exploration of boundless possibilities with Binske’s line of Ventus cannabis infusions. Break off a 10-mg piece of their 47% Peruvian Nacional Dark Milk with hazelnuts, and experience pure euphoric bliss. Or receive your dose of cannabinoids from their pure and raw Wildflower Honey. Dive into something new with Binske’s Olio Nuvo, meaning “New Oil.” This extra virgin olive oil is high in antioxidants and exhibits complex notes of fruit, pepper, and bitterness.

Fire

Ignite your senses with a Binske product from their Ignus line. Their Honduran Oro Maya Cacao chocolate bar is a delicious treat and contains 75% pure Oro Maya. For a delicate, sweet and buttery honey with undertones of cinnamon and nutmeg, turn to Binske’s Clover Honey. Perfect for sweetening your favorite tea or drizzled over chevre. Spice your meal and activate your endocannabinoid system with their Chipotle Olive Oil. Their blend expresses the warm and smoky chili flavor of chipotle peppers to deliver spicy complexity without being too hot.

Water

Binske’s Aqua line features Honduran Oro Maya, a 65% pure Cacao chocolate bar with raspberries and 100 mg of THC. Rethink traditional dressing with Binske’s Lemon Olive Oil, an excellent companion to fish, chicken, or salad. Taste an explosion of bold sweetness and subtle citrus flavor with their floral and fruity Orange Blossom Honey.

Lab Testing

Binske is pleased to offer lab-tested cannabis products provided by multiple facilities to guarantee accurate potency and purity. Their products receive full-spectrum testing that includes readings of cannabinoid profiles and percentages, residual solvents",,3353,3c/3c915ff29af6ed70cefac1a1a940bfecb40eeadb.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/714/avatar/original/1619208616-b_hummingbird-binske_black.png,@binske,BINSKE,4.58837223052979,34,binske,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/binske,http://www.binske.com,,,,,,,,,,,

Blazing Ape OG Kush is Michigan’s source of premium cannabis products derived from a unique cut of their in-house strain. Toke and dab on flowers and concentrates of the highest quality, crafted by and created for cannabis connoisseurs. Blazing Ape OG Kush is the result of many years of industry experience. Long before the days of everyone and their brother being an extraction artist, the Blazing Ape OG Kush team were in the lab creating slabs of fire. Experience Michigan’s real OG, euphoria is just a blaze away.
 
 
 
Process
 
Premium quality and industry best practices go into every aspect of Blazing Ape OG Kush products, from soil to oil. First, the founder/master grower cultivates Blazing Ape OG Kush flowers in his boutique cannabis garden. Once those flowers reach the highest genetic potential, the buds are carefully harvested and cured to perfection. From there, some of those buds go out to market while others are used for extraction.
 
 
 
The Blazing Ape OG Kush founder then takes his yield and isolates the cannabinoids and terpenes locked inside the bud’s trichomes. The result is beautiful slabs of shatter and sugar, a clean and high-quality extract.
 
 
 
Products
 
No matter which way you blaze, pungent flavors and stellar effects are sure to follow. Blazing Ape OG Kush flowers are their signature in-house cut of OG Kush. These buds deliver a massive buzz expected from a Kush strain while leaving users with uplifting, cerebral disposition. Now take that experience and amplify it. Blazing Ape OG Kush’s premium flowers are offered in Terp Sugar and Shatter. Blazing Ape OG Terp Sugar delivers the pungent, sour, and diesel flavors of the strain to front and center. As for the Shatter, every dab is a delight. The experience mirrors every characteristic of the flowers with an added boost of potency and flavor.

The safety and efficacy of Blazing Ape OG Kush’s flowers and extracts are paramount to their team.

There is great power in the people around us. They motivate and inspire us. The more we draw from them, the more rewarded we are. And the more empowered we are to affect those around us. To see the power of community, one has to look no further than Blis’s Los Angeles, CA headquarters and other stores around California.
 
 
 
THE SHIFT IN HEMP CBD
 
 
 
Blis has always believed in the power of hemp CBD, but today that power is even greater as the hemp CBD world is changing in a profound way. Hemp cannabis is moving from over 70 years of prohibition to a mainstream crop. And it’s far bigger than the actual crop- it’s a lifestyle. The way people perceive Hemp CBD, how they define themselves by their Hemp CBD lifestyle and how they experience Hemp CBD is far different today than in the past. For many, Hemp CBD is not what they do, it’s who they are. Today, people who live this CBD lifestyle are bonding over collective experiences and that is what motivates them, drives them and fulfils them. In the end, it makes for a stronger community, or in Blis’s case, a stronger, more connected company.
 
 
 
BLIS’S TRANSFORMATION TO “THE HOME OF HEMP CBD”
 
 
 
In 2019, Blis embarked on a path forward. Blis would set a course to become the undisputed Hemp CBD retailer. For Blis, this shift was really about claiming a position the brand envisioned in the past. Blis was looking to its heritage to define its future. But before announcing this message to the world, Blis first decided to look internally and begin with it’s own employees. To be successful, Blis understood that it first needed to make believers out of those who would ultimately be spreading this powerful message.",,130,26/26f245646902ba5fb0e76130b8c7988cc772dc3a.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/007/858/avatar/original/1563559834-blis.jpg,,blis,0,0,blis,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/blis,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it’s origin dates back to the early 2000's as a highly sought-after strain, that made its rounds in California, but would soon disappear when Jeff migrated to British Columbia with his wife, and medicinal marijuana activist, Michelle Rainey. Along with being a cancer patient, Michelle suffered from Crohn's disease and found relief of her symptoms within this special strain. She then dedicated her life to helping others gain medical access to the plant that has done so much to alter her life and daily function. Michelle sadly passed away from cancer on October 20, 2010 with the dying wish of making cannabis accessible to everyone, specifically the Afghani Bullrider.

BLLRDR is changing the Canadian marketplace in a big way. Under the shared vision of Jeff and Noah, BLLRDR is bringing Michelle's dream to fruition by commercializing the Afghani Bullrider strain as well as other unique products.

3228,"Someone near and dear to our hearts was diagnosed with Autism a few years back and since then we have been on a quest to find ways to bring him out of his fog and help him find joy in this confusing, somewhat scary world we live in. We heard about CBD helping kids with epileptic seizures and the possibility of it helping alleviate the symptoms of the Autism Spectrum Disorder. So, we decided to start researching and testing different CBD products to see the effects and decide for ourselves if it works.
 
 
 
In our research, we came to realize the huge variety of applications CBD has beyond helping with seizures and ASD. From insomnia to anxiety, severe pain to depression, CBD has been shown to alleviate a number of conditions and ailments that plague our world. We live in a toxic world, let’s face it. The importance of going organic, drinking pure water, etc., is very evident.
 
 
 
With CBD, it’s no different. Our products are Organic, Raw, Full Spectrum, CO2 Extracted and 100% Effective so you can be sure it’s only the highest quality product you’re putting in your body. We put quality and effectiveness as the priority so you don’t have to worry. The difference is clear when you try our CBD products.
 
Do your research. With such a wide selection of CBD products out there, it’s good to think about what’s important to you.
 
 
 
CO2 extraction means our CBD doesn’t sit in a vat of alcohol during the extraction process and it isn’t heated up, which burns off the major healing elements of the plant. It’s a patent-pending extraction process that allows our CBD to have the highest percentage of raw product (CBDa) remaining after extraction. Your body knows what to do with raw plants. This means the remaining organic product maintains a majority of the essential vitamins, nutrients, and compounds necessary for true healing properties.
 
 
 
Full spectrum means as many of the cannabis cannabinoids are present in our CBD oils as possible. Each cannabinoid has its own set of known healing elements. We steer clear of isolate products, which, we believe, have little healing properties.
 
 
 
Offering the highest quality CBD available doesn’t mean high prices either. We are committed to providing the purest, high-quality CBD at the most affordable prices. You’ll find that our CBD Oils taste great, as well. We use pure, organic, raw stevia and organic flavoring to make our products enjoyable to take. The best of all worlds!

We start by hand selecting specific cultivars that are specifically grown for hash. These plants are handled less, harvested with care to not touch the buds, and immediately frozen during harvest to ensure freshness. We then wash the buds in purified water to ensure a clean product. By hand we gently move the buds through the ice and water mixture using a paddle to preserve and not damage the trichomes. We collect then collect the separate trichomes and filter based on size. This uses the process of sublimation. This means we freeze the product and dry it under freezing temperatures to retain the most flavor and aroma. After drying we then package in small bags used to filter the hash when we press it into rosin. This leaves you with a healthy pure product that represents the quality other the buds it was made from.

Nuestro planeta está sufriendo una perdida constante de su diversidad genética y el cannabis no es una excepción. Es responsabilidad de nuestra especie preservar todas estas formas únicas de vida y mantener la biodiversidad de nuestro entorno.
 
Las variedades puras, origen de todas las variedades comerciales y domésticas existentes, son consecuencia del gran poder de adaptación de esta planta a los diversos ecosistemas de nuestro planeta, así como de las intensas relaciones centenarias entre el hombre y el cannabis.
 
Las variedades puras están desapareciendo por muy diversos motivos, como son la eliminación de sus habitats naturales, guerras, pérdida de culturas ancestrales, contaminación genética de las variedades locales debido a la globalización y sobre todo, por la prohibición que sufre esta planta en casi todo el planeta.
 
Aunque se cuentan por centenares las aplicaciones industriales, medicinales, energéticas y alimenticias del cannabis, aún no se ha desarrollado todo el potencial que esta planta nos puede ofrecer.
 
Muchas de estas variedades puras tienen un perfil de cannabinoides y terpenos único, que podrían servir para tratar muy diversas enfermedades.
 
En ACE Seeds queremos contribuir a mejorar la falta de diversidad genética y parar la depresión endogámica que sufren las variedades comerciales actualmente, ofreciendo innovadores híbridos criados a partir de nuestras propias líneas estabilizadas.
 
Estamos orgullosos de presentaros las variedades de nuestro nuevo catálogo, procedentes de distintos criadores y coleccionistas privados. Estas genéticas son exclusivas y en algunos casos de stock limitado. En ACE Seeds esperamos que disfrutéis esta temporada probando nuestras variedades.

4749,"Airo Brands is committed to delivering a superior cannabis experience using the highest quality materials and latest technologies.




We are driven to create an intuitive, virtually effortless, and cleverly designed vapor experience. Our team saw what the vape world had to offer, and we knew we could do it better with a focus on design, vapor delivery, quality, and one-of-a-kind oils. We organically formed a working belief that drives us each day: no detail too small. After two years of combining craftsmanship, technology, and research, we delivered a virtually unparalleled vaporizer system. We selected the best high-performance ceramic atomizer, so our unique oils provide a consistent and unaltered experience from first draw to last. 




Backed by extensive research and development, the AiroPro vaporizer sets a new industry benchmark in convenience. There are no buttons or switches to complicate use, just inhale to activate. A light vibration indicates when the device is on, so the amount of vapor per hit can be accurately gauged; this feature improves the level of control users have over their device beyond that of any other personal vaporizer.




Our innovations aren’t limited to our vaporizers alone—we’ve also reimagined the AiroPod oil cartridge design to support a plug-and-play system and maintain superior leak resistance. The AiroPod cartridge and AiroPro vaporizer are the first cartridge and vaporizer to feature magnetic cartridges that can be exchanged in an instant. Switching flavors is literally a snap. We offer five core curated series: Artisan Series, Artisan CBD Series, Strain Series, Live Resin Series & Live Flower Series. 




Combining our advanced technology with premium oil, we released the AiroX disposable vaporizer. Ready-to-go out of the package & disposable; there’s no charging required - ever.

1806,"ALPHA-CAT believes that the most important criteria for medical cannabis are the potency, stability and safety for patients use. We assist patients, doctors, dispensaries, cooperatives, collectives and growers in cannabis quality control & certification standard. We are an experienced company in Europe offering testing for potency, screening for safety and quality certification standard for legal cannabis production.
 
ALPHA-CAT believes that it is imperative to introduce a high-quality system for better production and usage of medical cannabis. There is currently an exponential growth in interest for medical cannabis from patients, doctors, industrial concerns and governments. Many countries have allowed cannabis for medicinal use but most of them have a lack of quality control. The re-introduction of cannabis as a medicine necessitates the introduction of a quality and safety-control management system.
 
So far cannabis has been used therapeutically for its THC content and we are only just starting to study and discover the benefits of CBD. However many other cannabinoids also have potential medicinal value. Which cannabinoids are present? How to titrate the dosage? How to produce a stable, reliable and consistent product? What are the therapeutic differences between various strains of cannabis? What are their precise concentrations?
 
ALPHA-CAT addresses all of these issues by providing potency testing, safety screening and quality certification standards for legal cannabis production. Our goal is to understand mechanisms inside the plant that determine the levels of the active constituents (genetics, terpenoids, cannabinoids…) for better medical application.

American Organic Flower is more than a cannabis brand. These sophisticated crafters of stylishly clean pre-rolls offer a lifestyle that’s effortlessly cool. Founded in Los Angeles, American Organic Flower offers the freshest pre-rolls on the market, adding nothing to let the balanced power of cannabis do its thing. Clean, sustainably sourced, and masterfully crafted, American Organic Flower offers pre-rolls in a league of their own.
 
History:
 
American Organic Flower’s founder got their start in the cannabis industry years ago, working as a local delivery caregiver, grower, and cultivator of marijuana brands. Wanting to start a pre-roll company, their founder was tired of buying unclean joints from his local dispensaries, covered in spit or filled with pesticide-covered cannabis. He wanted to introduce a cleaner product on which pre-roll lovers could rely, free of contaminants and offering a consistent marijuana smoking experience with each puff. Newly founded and ready to serve the Los Angeles market, American Organic Flower is ready to change the cannabis pre-roll game in SoCal for good.
 
Products:
 
Every package of American Organic Flower is crafted by hand, framing their pre-rolls in a container that’s equally as elegant and sophisticated. They stuff their machine-rolled joints with tons of flower, and each pack of 5 contains 4 grams of marijuana flower each. Their cannabis is tested utterly free of pesticides and sourced from the best quality Los Angeles growers, as well as flower cultivated in their own garden. All organic and indoor-grown, American Organic Flower’s joints offer consistent dosing with a balanced smoke and flavor, so consumers know the exceptional experience they’ll get with each use.
 
Lab Testing:
 
American Organic Flower deeply cares about quality and cleanliness and tests each of their pre-rolls with SC Labs for quality assurance. They lab test to make sure their flower is free of pesticides and other contaminants, as well as checking for consistent potency.",,98,94/94eefb3470583f275a2a4531aa61de70a56cd86b.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/366/avatar/original/american-organic_logo.jpg,,American Organic,5,27,american-organic,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/american-organic,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the reason CBD is present in all of our compounds. It's akin to adding a shot of espresso to every cup of coffee...it will work better and faster.

2153,"100% of our whole flower extracts are derived from the industrial hemp plant. Hemp is a species of cannabis that contains extremely low levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which, unlike marijuana, means our product is not derived from a plant considered to be a narcotic.
 
Our products are grown in the United States under the full legal protection afforded to us under section 7606 of the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill. By growing industrial hemp under the strict requirements of this program, we are able to guarantee our customers what they buy is legal to purchase, transport and consume under Federal law.
 
Few companies in the world can claim that they own their product from seed to shelf – we can. The genetics that underpin our product come from over 18 years of work beginning in Queensland, Australia. These certified seeds are used by our 8th generation farmers in Kentucky to grow our hemp outdoors with the full support of mother nature herself.
 
We work directly with the Lambert Initiative, one of the premier cannabis research foundations in the world, to explore the impact cannabinoids may have on human health. Unlike other companies in the space, we remain committed to supporting and participating in quality, rigorous research prior to making any claims regarding the benefits of cannabinoids.
 
Our extracts are what we call ‘full spectrum’. Our strong conviction is that the natural effects of the plant (CBD plus a range of other cannabinoids) is far superior to the big pharmaceutical approach, that our competitors take, where only a single molecule is provided (such as CBD).
 
People often ask us why we go through the trouble of controlling all aspects of our product or deal with the bureaucracy of federal law.

Newly christened, he deemed Andretti OG as the only bud fire enough to bear his name. With a traditional OG dankness and stoney high that knocks your socks off, Andretti OG is the first in a new line of excellent cannabis flowers for people who want to smoke the best.

History:

Andretti Cannabis Co. growers carry decades of experience as cannabis cultivators, tracing their OG’s genetics back through generations of cannabis growing. This OG survived years of raids, relocations and more, never crossing and originally popped from seed. When Curren$y discovered this master strain at a High Times cup, he knew it was something special. After a few meetings he and the growers decided to unleash Andretti Cannabis on the world, and after months of preparation, they launched at the start of 2017 to take the cannabis community by storm.

Process:

Andretti Cannabis Co. thrives thanks to the particular, meticulously technical growing methods of its cultivators. They use no PGR, no phospho-load or any other carcinogens to make them grow, simply letting the plant do its thing. Andretti OG is cut when it's ready, not on a calendar date, and the utter lack of pesticides offers a truly natural cannabis experience. Using coco grow, LED and HPS lights and moderate watering, Andretti OG and its fellow strains grow to perfection, resulting in a smoking experience that’s both original and classic.

Products:

Of course, Andretti OG is the headliner strain of Andretti OG’s brand. This OG is as pure as it gets; a potent Indica with a piney taste that will glue you to the couch for hours of euphoric mind bending. The other carefully cultivated strains include: Hashbar, Blue Lagoon, Purple Kush, and Watermelon Zkittles, all grown under the same high standards.

Lab Testing:

To ease the concerns of any consumer, Andretti Cannabis Co. tests to screen for THC content, pesticides, residual mold, mild, microbials and more to ascertain perfection in their strains.",,783,81/811d5c1ee0f124d898db1af33a7d6dd80e530b38.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/010/603/avatar/original/1598049889-ANDRETTI.JPG,AndrettiCannaCo,Andretti Cannabis Co.,4.46153831481934,1,andretti-cannabis-co,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/andretti-cannabis-co,,,,,,,,,,,,

1483,"To understand what Honey Oil is about, you’ve first got to understand its origins. It dates back to the 1970’s, when the first efforts to concentrate and obtain the essential oils from cannabis began. Initially, all these extractions resulted in was some sticky brown tar. However, as these methods evolved, it was soon discovered that a beautiful, golden-colored oil could be acquired from the plant. This elusive substance was eventually dubbed “honey oil” and was revered by those that got their hands on it.
 
Today, when the legalization of marijuana gives willing adults the right to smoke at their discretion, we want to pay homage to Honey Oil’s roots. We have taken this term, revitalized it, and elevated it. We use the latest technology to produce top-quality oils and concentrates that test as high as 97% THC. And Honey Oil products are not just potent—they’re also pure. We carefully test each batch in state-licensed lab testing facilities to ensure that they are free from contaminants and are on par with today’s standards of purity.

Honey Tree Medicinal is the defining benchmark for purity. Believing that medicine should be natural and organic, HTM doesn’t want to introduce potentially harmful compounds to cannabis patients. Using health conscious materials and precise, scientific extraction methods, Honey Tree Medicinal invites patients to join them at the crossroads of nature and medicine, offering natural and organic medicinal cannabis to those in need.
 
History:
 
Honey Tree Medicinal started as a passion back in 2006, in the heart of Orange County. The founders of HTM were using cannabis concentrates to alleviate their medical needs and improve their quality of life but saw the lack of access to cannabis as a major hurdle for the quality of life other patients in Orange County deserved. They felt a calling to connect the cannabis community to those in need of healthier alternatives to medicine and began learning to extract in a friend’s kitchen. Although they were competing with major concentrate and disposable pen brands, their extraordinary attention to purity and empathy for the community allowed them to help countless patients with a wide variety of ailments. From that kitchen in 2006 to today, Honey Tree Medicinal continues to grow, leading the forefront of the medicinal marijuana movement and helping patients every step of the way.
 
Process:
 
Believing in the natural, holistic power of cannabis, Honey Tree Medicinal uses all organic and health conscious materials. Using pure, food grade alcohol for their extraction, their concentrates go through a series of polished filters. It is then purged for 24 hours to remove the remaining alcohol. This process allows them to naturally capture both polar and nonpolar properties of cannabis, leaving all the desired cannabinoids and terpenes in the oil.
 
Products:
 
Honey Tree Medicinal‘s products contain the full spectrum of cannabinoids, not just THC. Accounting for THC, CBD, and other beneficial cannabinoids, their products also retain the natural terpenes from the original whole plant.
 
Along with their concentrates, HTM is also proud of their Disposable Vape Pens. Completely custom built, these lightweight and aesthetically pleasing vape pens are made with an all ceramic interior and no wick, meaning it won’t burn out.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Honey Tree Medicinal proudly tests all of their products at SC Labs, an independent cannabis testing facility in California. HTM tests for potency, terpene profile, and residual solvents (even though they don’t use solvents).
 
Networks:
 
Operating out of Orange County, Honey Tree Medicinal has been providing high-quality, pure medicine to Southern California since 2006.

The Difference?
 
During the post processing phase of the cannabis extraction process, there are a number of different things that affect the color, texture, and overall user friendliness of a hydrocarbon wax. Too much light exposure before intake for example, or the temperature of a transportation vehicle, and so on. In these cases, while the outcome is still a top shelf experience, with a high terpene product - the product may appear darker than a Bodhi High Product. These Premium extracts are the backbone of our Honey tree extracts line.

Estos tres conceptos son los cimientos sobre los que construiremos y daremos forma a esta pequeña empresa, dejándolos patentes en cada uno de sus departamentos.
 
Tenemos como prioridad fundamental optimizar todos los aspectos que comprenden la relación cliente-empresa. Por eso, ofrecemos un correo de contacto 24 horas con garantía total de respuesta antes de las 12 horas una vez enviado el mensaje, para absolutamente cualquier duda que le pueda surgir acerca de: un producto en concreto, el estado de su pedido, cualquier aspecto sobre el CBD, plazos de envío, opciones de pago, etc. No importa si es un comprador, alguien únicamente interesado o simplemente un curioso del mundillo, nos comprometemos a ofrecerle una comunicación y una calidad de trato sin precedentes en un muy breve periodo de tiempo.
 
Como no podía ser de otra manera, nuestro compromiso con la búsqueda continua de la máxima calidad, está más que presente en todos los ámbitos que engloban la vida útil del producto. Todas nuestras variedades han sido seleccionadas entre más de 20 proveedores a nivel europeo, decantándonos por estas, teniendo en cuenta el método de cultivo, análisis realizados y presencia de las características más buscadas dentro del mundo de los consumidores. Hemos querido que esta obsesión sea percibida por el cliente en el mismo instante en el que recibe el producto, por eso, diseñamos un envase que transmitiese a la perfección los 3 cimientos que citamos con anterioridad; materializando así, una vez más, nuestras palabras en hechos.
 
Vinimos a cambiar la idea sobre hacer negocios pensando únicamente en el “aquí” y el “ahora”, para introducir una metodología mucho menos vista, que no es otra que trabajar con una perspectiva a largo plazo, tomando decisiones siempre a 50, 100 o 150 años vista. Cabe recordar que esta última cifra es el número de años que una bolsa de plástico común tarda en degradarse, mientras que el tiempo de degradación de cualquiera de las botellas de plástico (PET) que solemos comprar en el súper varía entre los 700 y los 1000 años. Al comenzar este proyecto, no dudamos en aportar nuestro granito de arena y hacer todo lo que estaba en nuestras manos para reducir, hasta prácticamente la desaparición, el uso de plásticos en todos nuestros productos.

1996,"Ride the Purple Turtle
 
 
 
Honu invites Washington to ride the purple turtle. Through their menu of premium, award-winning cannabis products, euphoria is a Honu away. Their name is Hawaiian for “sea turtle” which in Hawaiian culture represents longevity, peace, good luck, and the human spirit within. Their mission is to craft the highest quality cannabis products and are the premier producer, and processor of cannabis concentrates, edibles, flowers, topicals, and vapes.
 
 
 
History
 
Honu’s first order was on 4/20 of 2015, but that isn’t their brand’s only moment of serendipity. Honu started on the medicinal side of cannabis, as a family operated business and the decision to get into the cannabis industry was made when one of the founders was diagnosed with cancer. While on a family trip to Hawaii they were on a beach discussing their plans of moving into the recreational market when a sea turtle swam to shore and approached them. The locals informed them it was a sign of good luck, and represented peace and longevity. Honu would be the name of their new family operated cannabusiness.
 
 
 
Since then they’ve been pleased to connect with the marijuana community across Washington, supplying them with a wide variety of high-quality cannabis products. Honu is excited to serve recreational cannabis users throughout Washington and strives to become available in more dispensaries as prohibition subsides.
 
 
 
Process
 
Honu is pleased to bring marijuana products that exude attention to detail, while also offering a wide variety of formats to satisfy every cannabis craving. Their edibles are crafted by the founder’s stepdaughter, a Chicago baker and head chef. Whether seeking something chocolatey, sweet, or even minty, Honu has premium marijuana edibles to satiate your hunger and endocannabinoid system. Their topicals are made with the ingredients and minerals your skin wants, such as organic beeswax, Jojoba Oils, and, of course, cannabis extracts. Honu flowers, cartridges, and pre-rolls hit the mark as well, introducing flavorful and potent strains into their buds and extracts.
 
 
 
Products
 
Quality is essential, and Honu offers patients a full range of premium medical marijuana products. Honu offers flowers, vape cartridges, edibles, and topicals giving patients many ways to ride the purple turtle. Dope Magazine named Honu best edible company, which is no surprise with their wide variety of delicious medicated options. Patients can enjoy medicated Peanut Butter Cups, Coconut Snowballs, or have a discreet treat with one of their Turtle Mints in Cinnamon or Peppermint. Their 'Gimme Sa’Mores!' offer fluffy marshmallows dipped in chocolate and rolled in honey graham crackers and pack 10mg of THC per bite. Those in need of topical relief can rub on one of Honu’s 50mg pain sticks, available in different scents. Toasted Hippie Pain Stick is a patient favorite and sports an aroma similar to Victoria's Secret 'Love Spell.'
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
 
 
Honu is proud to offer lab tested medical marijuana products. Their edibles are tested through Integrity Labs, and Honu flowers and concentrates go through Capital Labs. Honu also tests their products through other cannabis labs to check for variances. Honu is committed to supplying Washington with the cleanest cannabis edibles, topicals, flowers and extracts.",,284,a0/a0b6fa5ee95380d990a605a6f9505dd07177c188.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/996/avatar/original/honu-logo.jpg,,Honu,4.88888883590698,1,honu,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/honu,,,,,,,,,,,,

Created it to get his mom off her pain meds, she was becoming so reliant on them and they was damaging her from the inside out. It worked for her and people with simular pain symptoms. I began using it and turned it on to some friends of mine who all have their 215 and the response was outstanding, my only problem was I wanted to medicate my mind as well as relieve my pain. So I created a THC only infused extract using all organic chemistry.
 
GI soon found through experiments that it was a trifector, usable in three separate ways, it can be indegested as a edible, it can be put directly on the bodies place of pain as a topical, or the most popular way of recent, vaporized.

Our boutique facility was built with the goal of ensuring the final product will have strong genetic characteristics, robust flavors and a clean burn.
 
 
 
Cultivation 
 
Top-quality product starts, first and foremost, with top-quality cultivation methods. At Høst, we’ve constructed a state of the art cultivation facility. Piloted by a veteran team, our facility touts expert design for maximum efficiency, cutting edge horticulture technology, and a state of the art analytical lab. All of this comes together to produce a clean, high quality product.
 
 
 
Clean Inputs 
 
You are what you eat….and cannabis plants are no different. A healthy plant produces a healthy product. At Host, we utilize pharmaceutical grade nutrients (plant food) and 100% non-toxic (organic) pest and fungus controls. This means we raise only healthy plants. We also ensure that there is zero byproduct produced from our methods, keeping our product testing completely clean every harvest.
 
 
 
Curing 
 
One of the biggest concerns we’ve heard from dispensary owners is the lack of a properly cured product. All to often, wholesalers ship a product that is bone dry. This, coupled with Colorado’s already arid climate, creates an experience at the shelf that is simply unacceptable. At Høst, we’ve devoted a portion of our facility to a sealed and fully temperature/humidity controlled cure room. This ensures the optimal environment to produce the perfect cure, every single harvest.",,210,18/18280994fb86b08e67e3e137d14b1e2cbb522287.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/007/187/avatar/original/1559143152-host-raster_WM.png,,Host Cannabis,4.88235282897949,2,host-cannabis,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/host-cannabis,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was seventeen years ago, that the Sherr family moved from Southern California with the intention of building a small farm and a new home surrounded by Redwoods in the beautiful community of Humboldt. Through trial and tribulation, Reuven Sherr was able to produce consistent cultivations while documenting detailed regiments and standard operating procedures that he happily shared with his fellow farmers.

Years later, Reuven and his family created the Humboldt Brand Cannabis Company working with farms throughout the county to get you finest sun grown product in the state nourished by the soil and diverse ecosystem of the Redwood National Forest in what many would say the most ideal environment in the country for growing cannabis. When it comes time to harvest, manufacture, and distribute, Humboldt Brand takes pride in packaging and producing product alongside the greatest cannabis farmers in the country to give you, the connoisseur, the Premium American Cannabis experience.

History
 
Humboldt Seed Company was founded during a time when marijuana plants were mainly clones. Since much of the cannabis on the market originated from bags of mixed seeds with unknown genetics, it made identifying and producing flowers with medical benefit near impossible. That was when Humboldt Seed Company’s CEO and Chief Breeder began geno-hunting, seeking out stable seeds from trustworthy sources. Humboldt County growers often face the trouble of mold as the wet climate of Northern California is not ideal for many Indica and Hybrid strains. So, Humboldt Seed Company launched their breeding program in 2001 and began their mission to provide stable seeds for patients in need. Since then, Humboldt Seed Company has accomplished tremendous feats in genetic development, creating stable strains suitable for California’s various climates. Their collective gladly offers to share their knowledge and distribute wellness through their marijuana seeds and extracts to any patient in need.
 
 
 
Process

Products
 
Humboldt Seed Company provides a menu of high-quality seeds along with a wealth of information about each of their strains. Their philosophy of honesty and purity in cannabis guides their collective to provide as much education to their customers as possible.
 
 
 
Royal Highness is a Humboldt Seed Company original - this strain produces dense flowers with light-green and deep-violet nugs. Humboldt Seed Company cultivators crossed Humboldt Headband X OG Kush XAK47 to create marijuana with a potent smoke that enables euphoria and enlightenment. These buds are potent - Royal Kush’s frosty nugs yield potential THC of 28% and above.
 
 
 
Humboldt Seed Company’s signature strain is Blueberry Muffin, which grows into uniformly frosty colas bursting with purple flakes. These ladies are potent in aroma and effects, with flowers that elicit a strong blueberry smell and energizing-yet-pain-relieving high.
 
 
 
Dream Queen seeds are also a large producer.Not only do these buds flower quickly, but they offer THC levels that push 23%. Dream Queen was the result of parent strains Purple Panty Dropper X Skunk #1 X Mazar Star coming together to create a strain with the dreamiest yields.

8904,"HVGC was founded by United States Special Operations Veterans (Marine Raiders). Since its inception, HVGC has been in discussions with some of the cannabis industry’s top researchers and has developed a veteran based protocol to effectively prove the benefits of medical cannabis. HVGC is supported and essentially ran by three Marine Raiders that served following 9-11.

Over time, and through HVGC presentations and seminars, the principals of HVGC realized a recreational brand will be a monetary success and will help fund the ultimate mission of HVGC, providing medical cannabis to the veterans of our United States Military.

As a service disabled veteran owned business, HVGC is intimately aware of the daily challenges that our fellow veteran brothers and sisters face as a result of their time spent on the battlefield. Some of these wounds are not visible to the naked eye.

Our country is facing a wide-scale opioid epidemic that has taken countless lives; not excluded from this crisis, the veteran community has been critically impacted. When the U.S. Military deploys to the combat theater, roughly 60% of those deployed will be prescribed opioids upon return to the United States, and over half will develop a dependency/addiction. This has caused far too many vets to lose their way, and in an ever-increasing pandemic, take their own lives.

HVGC began its outreach into the veteran community by observing first-hand and listening to the suffering of our veterans. We knew right then that our cause was worthy; and that our mission was defined. Our next step moved us into researching medical cannabis and speaking with the top experts in the field. As our research progressed, the answer to this crisis became clear: develop alternate medical solutions for those suffering with pain, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, sleep disorders, and most critically, are at significant risk of suicide. We care about those who suffer and believe that medical cannabis is the way of the future to help those in need. The recreational cannabis and branding will be used to assist in accomplishing these goals and ultimately serve as a profit center for HVGC.",,209,86/866770f7856ecc7e50f98747494b575e8dbbb601.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/008/904/avatar/original/1591818520-Asset-3__1_.png,,HVGC - Helmand Valley Growers Company,4.66666650772095,2,hvgc,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/hvgc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back in the day, consuming edibles could be compared to spinning the roulette wheel. Edible consumption meant risk, because effect and dose were a mystery. Our founders, Josh Fink, Derek Cumings, Rick Scarpello, and Bob Eschino, helped change that.

Infinite CBD delivers premium quality, hemp-derived, cannabidiol isolate products at affordable and compassionate prices. Their mission spans past the spectrum of the cannabis community; with their line of entirely CBD-based products even those who are non 420-friendly can find non-intoxicating relief. Without compromising a single bit of quality, Infinite CBD provides some of the most competitive pricing on the market. Every batch of hemp flowers arrives with lab tested results and every isolate tests above 99% CBD content. They’ve conceptualized every product with their customers in mind, and their line of cannabidiol products provide infinite possibilities for holistic wellness.
 
 
 
History
 
Infinite CBD was formed to supply a non-intoxicating option for those seeking natural relief without the effects of cannabis. The benefits of cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol are undeniable, and the founders felt these benefits ought to be shared. They wanted to create products that would help people achieve a healthier lifestyle and improve quality of life, and so developed a line of hemp-derived products that contain 99% or above CBD content. Although, not technically a cannabis product, the Infinite CBD team were still subjected to the stigmatization attached to marijuana. But the proof was in the product, and many throughout Colorado found relief through their products. They overcame the taboo of utilizing a cannabis relative. Today, Infinite CBD is a brand people rely upon to ease pain, calm inflammation, reduce anxiety, and for much more.
 
 
 
Process
 
Infinite CBD sources their starting material from a local, Colorado farm that cultivates high-quality industrial hemp. Then those hemp flowers are processed using a proprietary extraction method to yield the most potent extractions. Their extraction artists take the extra step of removing the humic acid, leaving pure isolate free of any yellow-ish color with a longer shelf life. Then, their pure, solid CBD crystalline is pulverized into a fine powder -- making it ready for consumption.
 
 
 
Products
 
From their raw CBD isolate to their vape cartridges and capsules Infinite CBD has a wide product line suitable for anyone seeking relief. Their raw CBD products include their CBD isolate, vape cartridges, and capsules. The Infinite CBD team have also introduced a line of products that utilize the synergistic effects that come from combining cannabinoids. Infinite CBD’s Absolute Zero and Vape cartridges deliver the entourage effect of cannabidiol alongside other cannabis-derived terpenes. Every cannabis-derived terpene profile emulates a strain-specific aroma, flavor, and effects. They've also introduced their Rocket Ship Suppositories, CBD gummies, as well as their A.M. and P.M. Capsules. Infinite CBD's A.M. Capsules deliver the benefits of cannabidiol with caffeine for an early morning boost. Their P.M. Capsules feature melatonin, providing lulling and relaxing effects.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
Infinite CBD products are lab tested by a third party for quality assurance and to ensure every product contains at least 99% cannabidiol content or above. Each batch of isolate from Infinite CBD receive full-spectrum test results from PureVision Technology, including present cannabinoids and their potency, terpene profiles, and for any present residual solvents.",,95,f7/f7867a2600e5d417c609d7300cc9de449045f0e5.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/608/avatar/original/Infinite_CBD_LOGO.jpg,,Infinite CBD,4.66666650772095,1,infinite-cbd,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/infinite-cbd,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of our extractions are done with super critical temperatures to ensure a proper filtration that can pick up particulates, lipids, and chlorophyll- leaving only the most desirable extract.

212,"Founded by C.E.O. Enas Barkho in 2012, Jet Fuel sets the industry and marketplace standard for high quality cannabis. The Southern California-based brand occupies the shelves of premier dispensaries and legal retailers throughout the state.




Operating manufacturing and cultivation facilities run by a dedicated team, the company has won dozens of awards and honors such as “Best Sativa Strain” and “Best Indica Strain” at the High Times “Cannabis Cup.” The brand Jet Fuel maintains a commitment to quality upheld by Enas and his entire staff.“One of the strains we produce is Jet Fuel OG,” he says. “It was our first strain under the Jet Fuel brand. Since the strain smelled like high quality gas, it lent itself to the name.”




From its onset, the brand became a sought-after staple. Launched at the Paid Dues Festival, it went on to permeate popular culture. Legendary Cypress Hill co-founder B-Real served as an initial brand ambassador. Meanwhile, Jet Fuel grew its own legend. Lil Uzi Vert namechecked it on “Boring Shit,” and the late Mac Miller paid homage to “Jet Fuel” on his final GRAMMY® Award-nominated album Swimming with a song of the same name. Jet Fuel notably made its way into the hands of everyone from The Weeknd’s XO Collective to Snoop Dogg and transformed into a perennial favorite.




Rooted in personal attention-to-detail, Jet Fuel flourished due to Enas’s history in the business and long-term experience as a grower.




“We’re cultivators and producers of our own flower - We’re the actual growers. We’ve worked with this plant for a very long time. It’s personal to us, and that makes all the difference.”




Since it took off to the forefront of the cannabis market, Jet Fuel continues to soar at the highest altitude of quality.

At Jody’s Original CocoaBudder, they say “rub it on, and the pain is gone” because it’s true. The Jody’s Original team is pleased to create a cannabis product that can be used by anyone. Jody’s Original CocoaBudder is a non-intoxicating lotion that provides the pain-relieving benefits of cannabis without a head-change or additional effects. The active cannabinoids aren’t the only thing to get excited about when it comes to Jody’s Original CocoaBudder. Their lotion contains all natural, high-end ingredients your skin craves, leaving you smooth, radiant, and pain free.
 
 
 
History
 
The founder of Jody’s Original CocoaBudder entered the cannabis industry in 2012. She was working at a dispensary, where she got the opportunity to interact and connect with the cannabis community face to face. She noticed the high demand for cannabis-infused topicals, but the only ones available were super greasy salves. She wanted to formulate something that delivered the same all-natural relief, but could also serve as a lotion. She partnered up with a team that shared her vision and enthusiasm for cannabis. The team took a year to formulate the perfect cannabis lotion, and in 2014 were proud to debut their cream to the marijuana community of California. Since then, local support has taken the team far; and in 2017, Jody’s Original CocoaBudder became an LLC. Today, their team strives to continue reaching those in pain and supply a natural and holistic solution.
 
 
 
Process
 
Jody’s Original CocoaBudder begins with cannabis flowers cultivated at a high altitude, resulting in less oxidized flowers. Those high-quality buds are decarboxylated into cocoa butter, then filtered. From there, the active cocoa butter is introduced to their other ingredients to result in a non-greasy, pain relieving, hydration.
 
 
 
Product

Prism/Joiant has been providing a full spectrum of innovative CBD:THC blended cannabis products to California patients and consumers since 2016, earning the number 1 position in sales of CBD-dominant pre-rolls in CA. 
 
 
 
Joiant premium blends and pre-rolls provide dependable and fast-acting effects, ranging from relaxation to pain and anxiety relief to an uplifting creative rush, depending on the blend. Joiant (pronounced ‘joy-ant’) is rooted in the French word joir, which translates to “intense pleasure, joy”. Cannabis lovers have always had a certain “joie de vivre,” and Joiant will now bring them a new “Joiant de weed.”
 
 
 
“We felt there was a unique quality to our products that the name didn’t capture,” said company founder, Lindsey Kirk. “When we landed on our new name, we were delighted to find a word that not only captured the joy and lightness of our brand promise, but that also hearkened back to one of the timeless, iconic terms of the cannabis world: the joint.” 
 
 
 
Joiant is a homegrown California cannabis brand, founded by former Kiva Confections brand ambassador Lindsey Kirk after spending two years visiting SoCal dispensaries and seeing firsthand the need for convenient, reliable CBD and THC blended inhalables. In 2018 data firm BDS Analytics named Joiant the number 1 CBD preroll brand in California

Head of Honey takes cannabis extractions to new levels with a line of premium concentrates that exude unheard of potency and flavor. With great attention to the starting material, Head of Honey lives by “Fire in, fire out,” --a motto that promises perfection from start to finish. Head of Honey provides more than just high-end cannabis concentrates on the cutting edge of extraction technology. The brand is operated with love and compassion and each team member wholeheartedly believes in the life-enhancing potential marijuana provides. For Head of Honey, the cannabis community comes first. Every effort the team makes is to supply products that deliver an incredible experience with every dab.
 
 
 
History
 
Head of Honey was born from a team of passionate cannabis advocates with several years of experience in the industry. The founder, Jordan, envisioned a cannabis extraction company with a heart. One that is innovative and pushed boundaries but always supplied consistent, safe products..
 
 
 
Head of Honey was established in 2015 and spent the following two years perfecting its products and ensuring the brand stayed ahead of the curve with regulations.
 
 
 
In September 2017 the Head of Honey team proudly debuted its cannabis concentrates to the Colorado cannabis community. The extracts got into high-end dispensaries in no-time, people fell in love with the brand’s samples and were eager to have Head of Honey on their shelves. Today, Head of Honey continues to produce incredible cannabis extractions. The team was personally impacted by cannabis, and its mission is to be a conduit for an enhanced quality of life.
 
 
 
Process
 
Fire in, fire out is a real practice for Head of Honey. The team only works with a network of cannabis gardens that uphold the highest standard of quality. There are several attributes Head of Honey seeks when collaborating with a farm. Cultivation practices are huge, and from the genetics of the flowers to how they are cured Head of Honey leaves no stone unturned.

The Problem: :Like most consumers of cannabis products we wanted to enjoy a cannabis-infused beverage that would put us in the right headset.

We searched high and low for a drink that would provide the same FAST and STRONG results as smoking provides. 

Unfortunately, the problem with current beverages in the market is that they contain non-bonded cannabinoids that are fat soluble .

As science constantly tells us, oil and ""water"" don't mix. Fat-soluble cannabinoids (and their poor efficacy) have a late onset of effects and often an unpleasant taste. 




The Solution: Headset utilizes its proprietary IV-THC technology to produce a water soluble THC beverage designed to bypass the blood brain barrier at a FAR more efficient rate! Headset dissolves evenly for consistent and reliable dosing while doing so rapidly and intensely while tasting amazing! Gone of the days of wondering when and how hard your beverage will ""hit"".

Who is Hemp Doctors USA?
 
Hemp Doctors USA Cares about You, Your Body & Your Pets!
 
We are a lifestyle enhancement company that sells trusted American Grown and naturally healthy full spectrum hemp-derived topical products and dietary supplements.
 
For thousands of years people have used full spectrum hemp products to achieve optimal health and wellness. Bringing American Grown and naturally healthy hemp derived products to people and their pets has been a journey of the heart and soul for me!
 
Hemp Doctors USA’s sole mission is to create a healthier world, as well as, a more balanced life which is why our motto is, “ Live Well. Have Fun.”
 
As the owner and founder of Fitness Doctors here in Austin, Texas, I have cared passionately about people, their bodies and health for the past 25 years, so with that in mind, I founded Hemp Doctors USA in 2015 with the goal of educating people about the benefits of full spectrum hemp derived products to assist with many things that come up in life that affect living well and having fun!
 
As a direct result of my working in the strength, sports conditioning, personal training, medical exercise and post- surgical exercise industry, Hemp Doctors USA provides another way to bridge the gap between healthcare and optimal wellness.
 
Full Spectrum Whole Plant Hemp Derived products can improve the quality of life for people with: inflammation, anxiety, cancer, insomnia, seizures, fibromyalgia, migraines, Crohns, colitis, neuropathic pain and so much more.
 
We are a forward thinking company whose daily endeavor is to provide a way for people to obtain American Grown, natural, premium hemp-derived oils, salves, lotions, and dietary supplements to support living a healthy lifestyle where ever they be. We strive to educate the public on the sustainability, versatility and nutritional benefits of hemp.

Everyday there are more stories emerging of how lives are being transformed by hemp derived extracts that can be used on the body, in the body or both and we want to accelerate the availability of one of mother natures best anti-inflammatories and neuroprotectants to everybody, everywhere!
 
What is CBD?
 
Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the most important healing substances in the hemp plant with a strong anti-inflammatory effect without a psychotropic or narcotic effect. CBD is a phytocannabiniod, which has been recognized for its benefits on human and animal health since 1992 when researchers discovered the Endocannabinoid System in the human body! The ECS is made of cannabinoid receptors ready to receive naturally occurring cannabinoids to maintain a stable and balanced internal environment; the reason why CBD is lauded with so many positive effects when used orally or topically.
 
When applied topically, taken orally or both, CBD dovetails with the human body’s central regulatory system of receptors which is responsible in establishing and maintaining human health.
 
The best endorsement of CBD actually comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which filed a patent in 2003 on cannabinoids' potential use. The patent 6,630,507 states that CBD and other psychoactive cannabinoids can limit damage from brain trauma, stroke, Alzheimer's, and other diseases.
 
Another important item to note is that full spectrum hemp derived CBD has a remarkable safety profile. Full spectrum hemp derived CBD hemp oil promotes a calming, sedative effect and works against convulsions, anxiety, insomnia, neuropathic pain and ulcers. For more information on the benefits and research I would suggest consulting projectcbd.org as well as PubMed. Hemp derived CBD is currently classified as a nutritional supplement. It can be taken as a tincture for fast absorption, as a capsule for easy dosage, or topically, all with the same goals of well being.
 
It can also help your pets and provide the same types of benefits that are provided for humans. Hemp Doctors USA is passionate about offering a wide variety of healthy products for a wide spectrum of needs.",,194,da/daa88c583afc578779300043b7f644c0f8f8fae9.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/272/avatar/original/Screen_Shot_2017-02-26_at_12.46.41_PM.png,,Hemp Doctors USA,5,3,hemp-doctors-usa,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/hemp-doctors-usa,,,,,,,,,,,,
11301,"Passionate about the purity of our product, we are determined to stay at the forefront of CBD’s health & wellbeing benefits. That’s because behind the international brand of Hemp Future’s organic CBD, is a family business with strong ethics. Our reputation is in every bottle, and our Research and Development are entirely focused on meeting our customers’ current and future health needs and expectations.




It all began in January 2019. After years of research and idea development, the founder of Hemp Futures and CEO Steve Wyatt commissioned over 68 hectares of fertile, organic soil in Estonia, near the Russian border. It was where he cultivated EU certified Finola seeds, of which we engineered our CBD Warming Sports Gel, CBD Cooling Sports Gel, 5% pure CBD Oil, and 10% CBD Oil organic products.




Why choose Finola hemp? 




It was the first oilseed variety of hemp to be officially recognized by both Canada and the EU. Also, Finola produces high-quality, pure CBD oil that is mainly free of the psychoactive chemical THC. In other words, Steve chose a rich source of pure, non-hallucinogenic cannabidiol.

Only the best would do, for the products that Steve began to hand-craft and market. His aim was – and still is – to offer pure, organic CBD with genuine medicinal benefits, making it available and affordable for as many international customers are possible.

Our ethics include personally overseeing the cultivation of hemp that does not contain psychoactive elements. Instead, we optimize the potential of the finest hemp strain to yield the best CBD oil. Then, we manage our entire range’s production process, building our global brand by providing an authentically high-quality and medically-beneficial form of CBD.




In 2020, Hempfutures located a 7.5-hectare plot of land in Estonia. The top layer of soil was compacted cow manure, and underneath ancient beach floor sand, the soil could not have been better for growing hemp.




At Hemp Futures, we closely monitor every stage of producing the highest quality CBD oil, from working closely with the local communities and government agencies during the cultivation and harvesting processes to meeting the highest soil standards for organic certification and using only GMP certified extraction techniques. We offer the purest blend of THC-free ingredients for the highest medical benefits and peace of mind.

Here are Hempture HQ we truly believe as a human we are all morally entitled to know what enters our body and to judge whether we want to consume it or not. This is why Hempture CBD oil is sent for independent cannabinoid testing to Fundación CANNA which is one of the most advanced and internationally recognised laboratories in the world for HPLC analysis.
 
At Hempture it’s not just our organic CBD extract that make us special, it’s the people who bring it to the masses. They are carefully chosen for their approach in this area of expertise, enthusiasm and belief in this true wonder of nature – Hemp.
 
The extracts produced by Hempture are grown in Ireland & the EU without the use of any pesticides and herbicides. Our strict organic production allows our CBD oil to be of the highest quality ON EARTH and that is guaranteed fact.
 
Our CBD crystal is produced in a laboratory premises that is HACCP & GMP compliant, In addition we are proud to say the CBD crystal production line is currently in the process of ISO9001 certification!
 
We get this question quite a lot, so to make you aware, we abide by Irish and EU law. Regulation (EC) 1672/2000 states that cannabis sativa plants containing 0.2% tetrahydrocannabinol or less can be approved for cultivation as hemp with a licence. There has been quite a lot of red tape but we can confirm we are 100% legally operational. All the crops are grown under strict licence from the relevant government department throughout the EU.
 
You can now buy Hemp CBD oil in Ireland. Hempture products are handmade, prepared and packaged in Ireland and are of the highest quality available on the market anywhere in the world.
 
We primarily focus 100% on cannabidiol (CBD) products. We know these products inside and out, and want to help you make the best decision possible regarding cannabidiol. We have distributor channels in EU and the USA

La investigación clínica, muestra que los Cannabinoides son eficaces para calmar la tensión muscular y para la liberación de la ansiedad social y sexual, neutralizando asi la incomodidad física. 
Muchos pacientes relatan que ellos son magníficos para mejorar la sensación y elevar el humor. Todo esto hacen de los Cannabinoides un compañero encantador en el placer sexual y la curación. 
Las decenas de miles de mujeres que han usado las fórmulas de Naturel Desir, han aumentado la experiencia de sus orgasmos, así como el alivio en situaciones de falta de lubricación natural.

El Cannabis en el amor actúa como estimulante sensorial y desinhibidor emocional, por lo general, aumenta la percepción de la temperatura, el gusto, el tacto, la percepción visual, el conocimiento del cuerpo, el disfrute musical y auditivo y la creación de fantasías y el humor. Otros efectos comunes incluyen cambios en la percepción del tiempo: a menudo se tiene la sensación de que el tiempo se ralentiza.

“Grow. Learn. Grow Some More.”
 
The High Five Farms team banned together to make high-quality, sun-grown flower readily available to the Washington cannabis community. Since their launch on December 18, 2013, High Five Farms experienced many changes,evolutions, and professional and personal growth from every team member.
 
 
 
In their first year, High Five Farms’ flower went to a processor, who turned their sticky, sun-grown cannabis into premium extractions. In their second season, they were ready to debut their flower to the public. High Five Farms’ product speaks for itself and once shop owners tried their bud, the sun-grown goodness was too dazzling to be ignored. Today, their marijuana flower can be found throughout Washington.
 
 
 
Process
 
 
 
“Cultivated with love”
 
Although every High Five Farms product exudes remarkable bud-appeal, the folks that comprise the team are the real show-stoppers. High Five Farms is family owned and operated, and the team has weathered many storms and challenges together throughout their cannabis careers. Each hurtle sharpened the team, and when experience meets unwavering dedication, amazing work follows.
 
 
 
High Five Farms has a large bank of premium quality cannabis seeds and many active strains ready for runs. They begin with organic nutrients and pest control utilizing the tools nature provides to nurture their buds. Then, those flowers are cared for by hand; each strain receives individual attention, care, and love. Once ready to harvest, High Five Farms carefully collects their heady nugs, then cures them to perfection for your smoking pleasure.

High Level Health Flower

All flower offered at High Level Health is top shelf and grown in-house. A main driving force behind our growing style is health derived ethics. We use the term “natural” to showcase the best methods, replicating how cannabis grows in nature. Each plant is carefully hand watered and inspected daily for quality and health. Throughout our drying process, we monitor for temperature, humidity, yeast & mold. We also employ UV air cleaners to ensure that the product is clean and healthy. This stage of production lasts 2-3 weeks. After the cannabis has dried, we cure it for another two weeks in jars. At High Level Health, we have 4 grow facilities in Colorado and one in Michigan. We exclusively carry High Level Health flower at all our locations.




Concentrates

In 2018, we started producing concentrates from our very own flower. By assembling a team of skilled extractionists, we were able to produce quality concentrates right from the beginning. Within the first 8 months of making concentrates, we were presented 19 concentrate awards, including 6 First-Place awards and an Overall Grand Champion award. Each gram of High Level Health concentrate captures the essence of the original strain and is packed with flavor.",/HighLevelHealthCO,653,9e/9e26c3750225a6d81ca77c345bae25fb7e0b3640.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/011/450/avatar/original/1644874932-0001_2.jpg,https://instagram.com/highlevelhealthco/,High Level Health,3.20000004768372,1,high-level-health-brand,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/high-level-health-brand,https://www.highlevelhealth.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the lack of unprocessed, gluten-free edibles in the market - Donna began creating her own clean edibles that she could enjoy with her family. Donna’s edibles show that you shouldn’t have to compromise flavor for a healthy product.

HighTech Edibles is serving the cannabis community and solving inequality one edible at a time. With HighTech Edibles, patients have access to premium, cannabis-infused gummies and hard candies.
 
 
 
Accessibility is paramount to the HighTech Edibles team. Their mission is to provide affordable edibles without ever compromising quality. HighTech Edibles envisions a healthier Michigan, free from opiate addiction and thriving. Through their line of medicated candies offered at fair prices, the HighTech Edibles team brings Michigan one step closer to a better future.
 
 
 
History
 
In 2013, HighTech Edibles’ founder began making her first cannabis-infused treats. Medical cannabis empowered her to overcome depression and transformed her quality of life. She wanted this healing tool to be readily available to those in need and noticed the edibles offered in Michigan dispensaries were sub-par. She decided to take action and created her own cannabis-infused gummies and candies.
 
 
 
Precision is key, and the founder toiled over creating accurately dosed edibles. Next came the flavor, she fine-tuned and refined until her candies tasted as pleasant as the effects they produce. After getting everything perfectly in place, she was ready to reveal her medical cannabis edibles to Michigan. In July 2016, the founder launched HighTech Edibles and has upheld her same devotion to quality ever since.
 
 
 
Process
 
Elevated standards.
 
HighTech Edibles operates their kitchen with commercial-grade standards. Before any candies are created, the kitchen is cleaned and sanitized. Then their gummies are crafted using the same mathematical formula to produce consistent edibles. Every batch contains the same total cannabinoids sourced from premium, activated butane hash oil. After HighTech Edibles’ candies are created, they are sent out for lab testing, packed, and sent to the dispensary for your medical enjoyment.
 
 
 
Products
 
Who said medicine had to taste bad? HighTech Edibles crafts gummies and candies in a myriad of delicious flavors. With over 30 different options, patients are sure to find their favorite. HighTech Edibles Gummies come in classic flavors like strawberry and blue raspberry as well as adventurous options like Mountain Mist and Lime Sherbet.

1396,"Get Hive.
 
After working for years in the cannabis industry learning the powers of the plant and cultivating compassion for patients, Jesse and Lynx created Hive Medicated Honey. While intrigued by extractions, they refused to create something impure, and thus began the search for other methods, eventually leading them to organic cane alcohol based extraction. In this a passion was realized and after many twists and turns of finding the best way to use the extracted oil, it seemed that honey was the perfect applicator. In 2015 Hive Medicated Honey began. Today, Hive Medicated Honey partners with local cannabis cultivators and third-generation bee extractors in Oregon to offer all natural, local, & strain specific medicated honey products.
 
To create their products, Hive Medicated Honey first procures their cannabis from local licensed producers in Oregon, selecting specific strains for their individual healing benefits in both THC and high-CBD options. They select and infuse finest grade local honey. The final product can be found in easy-to-use Honey Stix, jars and incorporated into other cannabis products.
 
As the medical cannabis program transitions to recreational, Hive Medicated Honey will offer their infused honey with high-CBD/low-THC levels, with 1:1 CBD/THC levels and as a high-THC (nug run). They will also be offering their full spectrum RSO oil directly in syringes for easy use.
 
All goods are lab tested by ChemHistory in Milwaukie, OR for the full spectrum of potency, pesticides and residual solvents. Hive Medicated Honey can be found throughout Oregon dispensaries in Portland, Milwaukie, Clackamas, Salem, Eugene, Independence and the coast. By the end of 2017, Hive Medicated Honey hopes to be in dispensaries all throughout the state of Oregon.",,71,a7/a758de7659cd9aa1fe6603dfca044ecba0ffdc6c.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/396/avatar/original/hive-honey_logo.jpg,,Hive Medicated Honey,5,2,hive-medicated-honey,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/hive-medicated-honey,,,,,,,,,,,,

2674,"Two holy herbs in one spray.
 
 
 
For centuries, Natives of the present California region utilized Santa Yerba, or “The Holy Herb” to alleviate pain. HolyHerbajuana has tapped into those benefits, crafting an all-natural, full-spectrum topical spray that delivers the synergy of Cannabis and Santa Yerba.
 
 
 
History
 
When peeking into the scope of HolyHerbajuana it is essential to recognize the history of California as well as the history of the brand.
 
 
 
Santa Yerba, or Eriodictyon Californicum grows naturally in the mountains of Southern California. Native Americans derived the flower’s benefits much the same way we use cannabis today. With smoke or brewed into tea, natives treated sprains, wounds, joint pain, insect bites, and much more.
 
 
 
HolyHerbajuana is led by two family friends, one a physician and the other a cannabis connoisseur with extensive knowledge of California’s native plants.
 
 
 
One day, the connoisseur was speaking with a gardener who enquired about cannabis. He recalled something his grandmother taught him: If you put cannabis in alcohol, you can extract and utilize the benefits without intoxication. This peaked the two friend’s attention. It occurred to them the same could be done with another plant they were studying: Santa Yerba.
 
 
 
They partnered to hone in extraction and developed a product that provided the benefits of cannabis and Santa Yerba side by side. After several batch tests and discovering the method that derives the full spectrum of phytocannabinoids and terpenes, they were ready to unveil their divine formulation. HolyHerbajuana launched in the Summer of 2017 and continues to supply holistic relief today.
 
 
 
Process
 
Consistency and simplicity are paramount to HolyHerbajuana. The team crafts a full-spectrum formulation with the most quality control and attention to detail, to ensure the HolyHerbajuana topical you use the first time is the same time and time again.
 
 
 
Product
 
HolyHerbajuana is a topical spray, crafted to deliver maximum relief through the properties of Santa Yerba and Cannabis. The spray includes a full-spectrum of cannabinoids derived from the finest Blue Dream flowers — a strain known and loved by many throughout the globe. Simply spray the afflicted area and allow the liquid to absorb into the skin. HolyHerbajuana is perfect for an all natural way to manage pain discreetly and effectively.

The gLeaf team is comprised of long standing medical marijuana advocates who’ve championed the Maryland medical cannabis program is it stands today. Before going by “gLeaf,” Green Leaf Medical was a group of entrepreneurs eager to guide the medical cannabis industry to properly serve the patients of Maryland. Philip Goldberg founded gLeaf in April of 2014, and sincethen he and his team of dedicated professionals propelled the advent of medical cannabis in Maryland. They testified at commissions and Senate hearings on behalf of caregivers in the state, shining a light on the needs of the often misunderstood cannabis community. The team even successfully lobbied to increase the possession amount for Maryland patients, which in turn increased the quality of life for many. gLeaf also hosted conferences for physicians and patients, which gave doctors the opportunity to educate themselves on how to implement medical cannabis recommendations in the treatment of their patients. Today, gLeaf continues to strive for progress both within and outside of its facility.

They utilize a variety of techniques depending on the end-product and bring the same level of care and attention to detail as gLeaf’s master growers.

The Glove Love team wanted to come up with something that we could all relate to; being from The Mitten and all. Our teams’ packaging represents all that makes The Mitten a marvelous place; The Great Lakes, the seasons, and mostly, medicinal cannabis.
 
From its Great-Lakes inspired styled packaging, to what the product can actually do medicinally, Glove Love provides the Michigan cannabis community with the opportunity to connect with a brand that truly understands them.
 
History
 
The Glove Love family assembled in 2015 with the mission to provide patients throughout Michigan the highest quality of medical cannabis. The team spent the next three years refining and perfecting until every aspect of production was just right. Then, in January 2018, Glove Love officially launched and presented its' line of best in class cannabis cartridges.
 
Today, the team continues to connect with all patients that seek a healthier alternative of medicinal use in Michigan. The team is always prepared for the next move and keeps striving for excellence.
 
Process
 
The quality of any extraction is determined at the farm and in the lab — no one knows this better than the master growers and extraction artists at Glove Love.
 
The Glove Love team begins the process by cultivating flowers at its cannabis garden, where the team meticulously tends to the strains’ individual needs. Once the buds have reached their potential peak point, then the team carefully harvests the buds and cures them to perfection.
 
Next comes concentration — Glove Love extraction artists isolate the cannabinoids and terpenes created inside the plant's trichrome. This process then leaves only the essence of the plant, delivering the flavor and effects each strain provides.
 
Lastly, Glove Love sends their concentrates to a testing facility; guaranteeing purity and potency — every drag, every time.
 
Products
 
Glove Love’s cartridges stand out from the rest. Glove Love encases their potent and flavorful cannabis oils in a wick-free cartridge, which allows patients to enjoy thick plumes of vapor without the potential of experiencing a burnt and unpleasant taste. Each concentrate displays an incredible amount of clarity; every oil is golden and translucent. With Glove Love Exracts, medication has never tasted better. When patients take a toke or a dab of a Glove Love concentrate they taste the full-spectrum of flavor sourced from cannabis-derived terpenes.
 
Lab Testing
 
The Glove Love family wants to make sure that they are providing their patients with products are the best for them medicinally, and health wise. Our team sends our products out for testing of the following: Mold, Mildew, Pesticides, Residual Solvents, Terpene, and Cannabinoid Content. Glove Love tests their products with Iron Laboratories to ensure their products get tested for everything listed above.
 

 
Next Generation, state of the art, premium cartridge
 
The Glove Love Gold Cart Top Air is the ultimate premium vaporizer cartridge. You get huge hits, one after another, Plus fabulous taste and a customizable airflow. A glass tank with ceramic and stainless core eliminates the wick and plastic. And, because there is no air intake hole at the bottom, Top Air cartridges do not leak. Cartridges just don’t get better than this.
 
Vertical Ceramic Coil 
 
Other cartridges expose oil directly to heating wires, creating the potential for heavy metal contamination. The Gold Cart Top Air does not. The revolutionary Top Air design completely seals the heating wire within a large vertical ceramic core.
 
Huge, Endless Hits
 
The high surface area and porosity of the large ceramic core hold more oil, so you get huge hits, one after another. It does not dry out like other cartridges. Top Air is perfect for heavy hitters.
 
Adjustable Airflow
 
Tired of cartridges with a hard draw? Just twist the mouthpiece and dial in the degree of airflow you want for your perfect customizable draw.
 
Fabulous Taste
 
We ran these carts against many others with a variety of oils. The Gold Cart Top Air had the best taste and cleanest flavor. Keep your voltage low to preserve the flavor and aroma of the oil.
 
High-End Hardware – No Plastic
 
Premium glass and stainless-steel components let you experience the pure unadulterated flavor and eliminate concerns about the chemicals in plastic.
 
No Leaking
 
We exhaustively tested many Top Air cartridges. We vaporized entire tank contents on some. We turned others on their sides or upside down in the hot sun for days. Results: zero leaks.
 
Battery Requirements 
 
Gold Cart Top Air works with any 510-thread battery with a button.Will not work with button-less batteries.",,1467,2e/2e7ec64ac10b1112789c88bae88646f989986f2c.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/862/avatar/original/1522694367-unnamed.jpg,,Glove Love,4.47349405288696,79,glove-love,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/glove-love,,,,,,,,,,,,

3176,"“It’s all in the name.”
 
 
 
The cannabis community are with purveyors of goodness, and GOOD is dedicated to providing that goodness to people throughout the state.
 
 
 
GOOD is comprised of horticulturalists, concentrate and edible manufacturers, and retailers of some of the finest cannabis products. Their three-fold mission is to supply cannabis products of the highest quality, provide education about cannabis, and support Alaskan communities through philanthropy. Goodness is woven into the ethos of all the GOOD team does — it's all in the name. 
 
GOOD believes that Alaska is a special place for many reasons, but especially because of the people that make up Alaskan communities. Alaskans band together to live and survive in some of the harshest conditions people experience. In this spirit, GOOD is committed to supporting and strenghtening Alaskan communities by giving back. Each month, the GOOD team volunteers their time with a charitable organization and contributes a portion of its earnings for that month to an Alaskan charity. From local homeless shelters, to soup kitchens, to recycling programs, GOOD is making a difference for Alaskans by supporting causes that make Alaska a better place to live.
 
GOOD believes the stigmas and misinformation surrounding cannabis can be mended with philanthropy and connectivity. The team is deeply rooted in their local community and have taken on roles in the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association and Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce. With these efforts, GOOD provides insider knowledge that eventually reaches the legislative level. This renders a local government with a better understanding of cannabis business owner’s and consumer needs. Thanks to GOOD, the state’s cannabis industry, products, and education improves a little bit every day.
 
 
 
History
 
Alaskans enjoy a lot of cannabis. From huddling together around a bowl in the cold months to exploring the great outdoors with a preroll in hand during the summer, it would seem that cannabis pairs perfectly with the Alaskan lifestyle. Although Alaskan’s love cannabis, there was a lack of education and not enough resources to premium products. The team was eager to face these challenges and bring Alaska into a new era of cannabis.
 
 
 
In 2015, the team began to develop its brand. The team thinks of themselves as more of a family than colleagues. All had successful careers in other fields but banned together to reshape the cannabis industry in Alaska. After a year of research and development and connecting with local organizations they were ready to launch. GOOD debuted their line of premium cannabis products in 2017 and has happily served the cannabis community ever since.
 
 
 
Process
 
Due diligence is paramount to the GOOD team. The horticulturalists employ industry best practices at their indoor cannabis garden, nurturing each of their plants to their highest potential. Then, those buds are carefully harvested and cured to perfection. Some of their buds are used to make prerolls and extracts like live resin or ice water concentrates. All cannabis products from GOOD are strain specific; they never mix different cultivars in the same extraction or preroll. Patrons will always have an authentic smoking experience that expresses the characteristics of the original flowers.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
GOOD is pleased to provide lab tested cannabis products provided by Canntest. Each product receives full panel testing from cannabinoid content to residual solvents.",,659,69/69881ab1a4c5738334c62789ebef3b0021f050b4.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/176/avatar/original/1541442067-GOOD_Cannabis.jpg,,GOOD,4.379310131073,7,good,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/good,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controlled conditions, discipline, and labor of love are the elements that comprise Good Titrations.
 
 
 
This Fairbanks-based cannabis company supplies concentrates, cartridges, and edibles to brighten and enhance your day or evening. Don’t get bogged down by long, frigid winters — with Good Titrations you'll feel the good vibrations all year long.
 
 
 
History
 
The founding team has advocated cannabis for many years, and each has done their part to bring legislation up to speed. Once cannabis legalized in Alaska, the group of friends saw a tremendous opportunity to introduce concentrates to the cannabis community in Fairbanks. They got to work solidifying their connections with premier growers and creating a safe and compliant extraction facility. Once all was in perfect order, Good Titrations was awarded their license in the Summer of 2017.
 
 
 
Process
 
Good Titrations sources the most exquisite buds in Fairbanks, cultivated in local cannabis gardens. Once those top shelf buds arrive at the Good Titrations lab, the transformation begins. Good Titrations' extraction artists isolate the cannabinoids and terpenes locked inside the plant’s trichomes leaving only the most desirable characteristics of the strain. The result is potent concentrates, ready for your dabbing enjoyment. 
 
 
 
Products
 
Good Titrations offers several textures of concentrates as well as cartridges.
 
 
 
Fairbanks’ cannabis enthusiasts that love to take dabs have ample options. Scoop a bit of Good Titrations’ Crumble for into your freshly heated banger or e-nail. The best part about Good Titration's crumble is you don't need a rig to enjoy it. Sprinkle a bit over a fresh bowl, blunt, or joint of your favorite flowers for a kick of extra potency.

Gooeyman is the guilt-free way to medicate
 
 
 
Gooeyman has made a canna-business out of exceeding expectations, creating Michigan’s first medicated, gluten-free granola bar. Gooeyman understands that patients medicate with marijuana to become healthier and improve their quality of life, and believes the ingredients accompanying the cannabis should do the same. Gooeyman presents a healthier alternative in the edible cannabis market with a health-focused cannabis product made with responsibly sourced ingredients. Medical marijuana patients with dietary restrictions can find aid and relief thanks to Gooeyman’s organic, high-quality granola bar.
 
History:
 
Gooeyman launched their brand one year ago to supply the medical marijuana community of Detroit with a healthier edible cannabis option. Their granola bar sets an industry standard, offering vegan or gluten-free marijuana users a healthy and organic alternative. Gooeyman is proud to have made it through their first year of being in the canna-business. One of the obstacles the ganja-preneurs of Gooeyman faced was the challenge of entering a saturated market with stiff competition. However, through the combination of determination and producing a top-notch marijuana-infused granola bar, Gooeyman stood out among the rest.
 
Products:
 
Gooeyman’s care and commitment to the medical marijuana community is what fuels their edible cannabis business. They are dedicated to reversing the stigmas attached to marijuana, through producing a consistent and reliable cannabis product. All of Gooeyman’s ingredients are organic and responsibly sourced. Gooeyman’s Gooey Chewy Bar is infused with Butane Hash Oil and has 100mg of THC. Ideal for medical cannabis patients that are mindful of what they consume or have difficulty processing gluten.

Our Beginnings
 
The beginnings of The Great American Cannabis Company LLC began a long time ago, but the first major milestone was the passage of State Question 788 on June 26, 2018. Nearly 60% of the voters of the Great State of Oklahoma voted to approve the legalization of medical marijuana. In doing so, the citizens enacted some of the most aggressive and progressive medical marijuana laws in the nation. The initiative petition driven legislation outlines specific rules and time lines for the state to comply with the wishes of the people. Within 60 days, permits and licenses must be available and businesses will be able to grow, process, and retail marijuana.
 
From this legislation, The Great American Cannabis Company was formed. We are an LLC in our home state of Oklahoma. Our goal is to provide the best and highest quality of medicinal marijuana within the state. While current federal laws regulate commerce to within legalized states, eventually these regulations (know as Schedule 1) will change. Oklahoma will be able to capitalize on the competitive advantage that other states don’t have and can’t replicate.",,110,df/df24fa0dc4ba6d61c50de556ed3709230535023d.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/008/862/avatar/original/1572393186-GreatAmericanLogo.PNG,,Great American Cannabis Company LLC,5,1,great-american-cannabis-company-llc,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/great-american-cannabis-company-llc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Winner of many international awards (40 High times Cannabis Cups, 17 Highlife Cups, and many more private awards in many countries), it is leader in cannabis genetics.
 
Arjan, owner and founder, has been acclaimed The King of Cannabis for his amazing record of cannabis prizes won throughout his career. He has always been committed to create the best genetics in the world, and to ensure that the growers choose the best genetics, based upon their location, logistics and personal knowledge.
 
Arjan started collecting genetics and landraces from all over the world 25 years ago, and the hunt is still on! (www.strainhunters.com).
 
Green House Seed Company genetics are the result of years of intensive breeding. All strains have exceptional medicinal as well as recreational properties, as well as particular terpene profiles guaranteeing unique aromas and flavors.
 
An overview of some of the most popular Green House strains:
 
The first and most important distinction to be made is the choice between growing outdoor or indoor. Once the decision is made, it is important to get the right type of seeds for the purpose. Most cannabis plants can be grown indoor or outdoor, but the peculiar characteristics of each strain always guarantee best results in one of the two ways. The personal or commercial nature of the operation will always influence the choice of the genetics. Sativas are usually regarded as higher quality, while indica strains are faster and more commercial.
 
Between the over 20 strains now sold by the Green House Seed Company there are true indoor champions and true outdoor champions. The Himalaya Gold is the most recommended outdoor plant, because of its genetic resistance to cold nights, altitude, pests and diseases. The origin of the plant is from the Himalayan region, and it proved an incredibly versatile and adaptable plant. Growers in the mountain regions of Italy and Spain love the Himalaya Gold for its high yields and sweet strong indica characteristics. Another true outdoor champion is the Arjan's Haze # 1, with great production and unique sativa high. The Arjan's Haze # 1 performs very well indoor, but outdoor the plants can grow to reach their development-peak and the maximum productivity. Moreover, solar light activates the production of a wider range of cannabinoids in the buds, guaranteeing a truly psychedelic effect. Besides, it finishes flowering in 11 weeks, allowing cultivation in most southern European countries.
 
On the indoor side, the best plants of the Green House Seed Company are Great White Shark, White Rhino, El Nino and the White Widow. All these strains belong to the “white"" family and share a common genetic origin. They are shorter, bushier plants with great bud production and amazing resin production. The bouquet and taste vary considerably, as well as the effect. The White Rhino in particular is very suitable for Sea of Green systems, where the plants are kept very close to one another and flowered at an early stage. It has a sweet taste and a great narcotic effect that made it popular with MS patients and chronic pain patients.
 
The Great White Shark and The Doctor are very popular between indica lovers worldwide. Their yields are amazing and the buds rock-hard.
 
The Hawaiian Snow, the Strawberry Haze and the Neville's Haze are good outdoor or indoor plants, but are mostly grown indoor because of their longer flowering time. Sometimes these varieties are given 12 hours of light from the very beginning, to keep them short and to shorten the flowering time. These are high-grade sativas, with an uplifting high and a very woody earthy flavor.
 
There are also plants that are very suitable for both indoor and outdoor conditions, such as the El Niño, the Alaskan Ice, the K-Train and the Super Silver Haze. These strains will perform incredibly good both ways, with some differences in plant development and yield. The Super Silver Haze in particular can produce more when grown outdoor, as the plants can develop taller and stronger branches can sustain the heavy buds.
 
The choice of the genetics remains one of the key factors in the success of every grower or breeder, and it is very important to acquire the most information before committing to the task.

History
 
Green Roads is on a mission to free people from dependence on opioids. Inspired by the incredible benefits of CBD, the founder was eager to get that holistic option into the hands of folks in need. He embarked on building a robust range of Cannabidiol, or CBD based products from extracts and edibles to tinctures and topicals. After fine-tuning every aspect, he was ready to showcase his creations to Texans and Floridians seeking natural relief. Green Roads launched in 2013.
 
 
 
Process
 
Green Roads ensures quality from beginning to end. Premium hemp flowers are cultivated to perfection then carefully harvested for extraction. The team derives the most desirable parts of the plant then infuses the concentrate into their various products. Some flowers are singled out for extraction, and their technicians produce many textures and potencies from isolate to shatter to crumble.
 
 
 
Products
 
Green Roads offers CBD products for every lifestyle. Whether you’re a busy parent or health aficionado there is a product for your road to wellness. Many flock to Green Roads 350 mg CBD Sublingual Tincture. Simply drip the desired amount under your tongue and allow the benefits of Cannabidiol to relieve pain, inflammation, and anxiety. Best of all, the tincture works quickly and packs full spectrum hemp, so your endocannabinoid system doesn’t miss a beat.
 
 
 
That isn’t the only way to achieve relief. Green Roads also offers 99.9% CBD isolate and CBD Crumble. Those who love to dab shatter will love CBD Pineapple Express and CBD ACDC, packing the fast acting and powerful effects without a head change.
 
 
 
Those that need an entirely smoke-free option can choose from Green Roads delicious infused candies and beverages. And those who would like to treat pain right on the spot can check out Green Roads’ CBD Pain Cream. No matter your needs or lifestyle there is a road for you.

Die Firma BHG Greenfield GmbH (vormals Firma Bernhard Pirker) eröffnete 2016 in Leoben den Greenfield Bio, Hanf, Grow und Headshop mit dem Ziel, einer breiten Gruppe von Menschen Produkte der Hanfpflanze zugänglich zu machen. Der gesundheitliche Aspekt von Hanf stand hierbei im Vordergrund der Überlegungen.
 
Dabei wird vor allem auf die Qualität der angebotenen Produkte geachtet. Qualität steht vor Quantität ist einer der Grundsätze unserer Unternehmensphilosophie.
 
Um unseren hohen Qualitätsansprüchen gerecht zu werden, wurde die Eigenmarke Greenfield Laboratory ins Leben gerufen. 
 
Die hier im hauseigenen Labor im steirischen Leoben hergestellten, hochwertigen CBD-Öle werden von unabhängigen Instituten zertifiziert und es werden strenge Auswahlkriterien an zuliefernde Händler gestellt.
 
In der Qualitätskontrolle werden unter anderem auch Schwermetallanalysen und Untersuchungen auf Schimmelsporen durchgeführt.
 
Dadurch konnte auch der Aufbau einer starken Marke in Angriff genommen werden, unter der man die produzierten, hochwertigen CBD-Öle (auch mit den Aromen Vanille, Pfefferminz, Zitrone und Lavendel, sowie Sport-, Tier- und Schlaf-CBD) auch als Großhändler auf den Markt bringen kann.
 
Um möglichst vielen Menschen eine „Vor-Ort-Versorgung“ mit Produkten auf Hanfbasis zu ermöglichen, wurde entschieden auch das Vertriebsnetz unter einer eigene Marke aufzubauen. Als Markenname wurde hier Hemptheke gewählt.
 
In den Hemptheken werden vorwiegend CBD-Produkte verkauft. Neben den CBD-Ölen der Eigenmarke Greenfield Laboratory finden sich auch CBD-Blüten (lt. EU-Nutzhanfkatalog) aus kontrolliertem Anbau sowie viele weitere Hanfprodukte im Angebot.",https://www.facebook.com/GreenfieldShopAT/,52,0a/0ab6387c65f5d6b6b3d0cd4648b0392d5a6879d4.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/777/avatar/original/1552645141-Greenfield_logo.JPG,,Greenfield,5,1,greenfield,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/greenfield,https://www.greenfield-shop.com/cbd-shop/cbd-blueten/,,,,,,,,,,,

Launched as a fully licensed and legal state operation since 2017, our master growers have a combined 30 years of cannabis growing and operational experience and knowledge. Along with our expertise, our state-of-the-art growing facilities and superior genetic strains enable us to produce California’s finest quality cannabis. Grizzly Peak gives recreational and medical users the ultimate cannabis flower experience.




OUR PROMISE TO YOU:




ALWAYS FRESH: We offer a rotating roster of strains to ensure that fresh flower is always available. We carefully monitor our cure rooms daily to guarantee optimal moisture levels. An attentive curing process allows us to preserve the terpene content, flavor, and effect of each strain. 




NATURAL COCO: We grow all our flower in natural coco coir. This growing medium provides more aeration to the plant’s root zone and allows it to maximize the absorption of nutrients. The result provides a smoother exhale for an even better smoking experience.




SEED TO SALE: We grow all our moms from seed and focus on continuously developing our own unique proprietary-owned genetic strains. No outside clone cuttings are ever allowed into our farm to ensure that we have complete control over everything that’s grown. We’re obsessed with ensuring that the best quality and care is given to our products starting from seed to sale. We oversee everything from cultivation and packaging, to branding and distribution. 




QUALITY AND SAFETY: We feed our plants with high quality nutrients, make our own salt feeds, and ONLY use OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) approved organically sourced pesticides. We’re dedicated to always taking the right steps so we can deliver the best product in the safest way possible.",,4836,ca/ca1fc367eb7eb382897367dc9e2e969290201d5d.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/232/avatar/original/1637358370-gp-logo-black.jpeg,,Grizzly Peak™,4.49431800842285,49,grizzly-peak-farms,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/grizzly-peak-farms,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our product lines include:
 
MIND: Contain high-THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol), formulations derived from stimulating varieties, commonly known as sativas. These formulations commonly act as stimulants and can be great for spurring creative thought and medicating during the day. Mind products are a good choice for patients who need relief and to remain alert and active.
 
BODY: Contain high-THC formulations derived from sedating varieties, commonly known as indicas. These formulation often produce relaxing and comforting effects. This makes Body products a good choice for patients seeking a slower and calmer cannabis experience and want to medicate in the evening.
 
BALANCE: Contain a 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC. This blend of CBD and THC combines the benefits of the two compounds into one balanced medication. Expertly calculated CBD:THC ratios maximize the synergistic properties and effects of both cannabinoids, creating powerful cannabis formulations that deliver many exceptional therapeutic benefits.
 
HIGH CBD: Contain high-CBD (cannabidiol) formulations. For most patients, a formulation that is high in CBD will produce a relaxing feeling without the psychoactive effects associated with high THC products. They are often used for treating conditions that have strong physical symptoms such as pain, inflammation, and spasms.

5077,"„Seiner Majestät, des Grünen Kaisers, Spezereyen“
 
Viele Legenden ranken sich darum, wie der Grüne Kaiser dereinst seine Liebe zum Hanf entdeckt haben soll. Gesichert jedoch ist, dass sich seine Majestät heute am Fuße jenes mächtigen Gebirgsstockes, der seinen Namen trägt, voll und ganz diesem Thema verschrieben hat, um seinen getreuen Völkern die Wohltaten dieser Pflanze angedeihen zu lassen. Darum setzt der Grüne Kaiser die Spezereyenmeister seines Hofstaats der beschaulichen Festungsstadt Kufstein auch darauf an, nur die besten und feinsten Blüten, Pollinate und Öle zu finden. Denn nur die höchste Qualität verdient es, in die Sammlung seiner Majestät aufgenommen zu werden und somit seine allerhöchste Empfehlung zu erlangen. Pflichtgetreu sind darum des Kaisers kräuterkundige Herbaristen im ganzen Reiche und seinen Nachbarländern auf der Suche nach dem Erlesensten, welches die bravsten Bauern und findigsten Veredler der Kron- und Erblande erzeugen.
 
 
 
Neben einer stattlichen doch nicht minder auserlesenen Vielfalt von Blüten und Pollen finden sich auch Extrakte, naturbelassen mit Kohlendioxid (CO2) aus der Pflanze gelöst, des Hoflieferanten „CannabiGold“ im Sammelsurium seiner Majestät. „Harmony“, ein weiterer getreuer Produzent für des Kaisers Palette hilfreicher Mittelchen, beliefert die Spezerey mit hochkonzentrierten Liquids, auf die viele der Anwender sowohl in der Prävention als auch in akuten Fällen schwören. Auch eine breite Palette feiner Tees und Aufgüsse aus den Blättern und Blüten der vielseitigen Staude wurde seiner Majestät von den Herbaristen wärmstens empfohlen, freilich ebenso verkostet und schließlich für so gut befunden, dass sie dem Volke in des Kaisers Namen feilgeboten werden können.
 
 
 
In Galizien und Lodomerien wurden die Gesandten seiner Majestät auf „CannabiGold“ aufmerksam. Die Raffineure versorgen seither alle kaiserlichen Lande mit Fläschchen und Kapseln feinsten, goldenen CBD-Öls. Auf ihren ausgedehnten Reisen stießen die Spezereyenmeister auf eine Manufaktur im beschaulichen Schwarzwald, wo Kosmetika höchster Güte ihre Herstellung erfahren. „CannaBioDerm“ verschrieb sich der Schönheitspflege für Damen wie Herren und überzeugte den Grünen Kaiser nicht zuletzt ob des feinen Bartöls, mit welchem seiner Majestät höchsteigener Gesichtsschmuck seitdem durch des Hofbarbiers Hände jenes schmucke Gepränge erlangt, welches zum Vorbilde vieler Untertanen wurde.
 
 
 
Bevor diese vom Grünen Kaiser höchstselbst verlesenen und somit geadelten Produkte ihren Weg zu den braven Untertanen finden, werden sie freilich umfassend geprüft und analysiert. Mittels einer HPLC-Untersuchung, der Hochleistungs-Flüssigkeits-Chromatographie, werden sie in den kaiserlichen Laboren von hochqualifizierten Wissenschaftern und Technikern getestet, welche die Gehalte von CBDA, CBD, THCA, D8-THC, D9-THC und viele weitere Bestandteile ermitteln, um sicher zu stellen, dass diese allen gesetzlichen Anforderungen und Normen entsprechen – denn seine Majestät setzt auf Produkte, die den legalen THC-Höchstgehalt von 0,3 Prozent nicht übersteigen und gleichzeitig auch eine verlässliche und konstante Konzentration des heilbringenden CBD garantieren. Mit Ausnahme staatlicher Behörden dürfen weder der Grüne Kaiser, noch seine Spezereyenmeister die Zertifikate an Dritte weitergeben.
 
Pflanzenkundige Bürokraten der Europäischen Union erstellten mit größter Akribie einen Nutzpflanzen- und Saatgutkatalog, in dem auch all jene Nutzhanf-Sorten, die in des Kaisers Auswahl Einzug fanden, gelistet sind. Ebenso hierauf legen die Herbaristen seiner Majestät größten Wert.
 
Die Österreichische Agentur für Ernährungssicherheit (AGES) kennt Blüten und Pollen der Hanfpflanze nicht als Nahrungmittel oder Zusatz, weshalb eine Einnahme derselben nicht empfohlen werden darf, eine Weiterverwendung muss sogar dem Grünen Kaiser untersagt bleiben. Auch als medizinische Produkte gelten die ausgeklügelten Präparate nicht, weshalb des Kaisers Herbaristen keine Angaben machen können, wie Blüten und Pollen verwendet werden könnten, welche Wirkungen sie entfalten und welche Dosierungen dafür angedacht werden müssten.
 
Desweiteren und eindringlichst weisen die Spezereyenmeister darauf hin, dass die Auswahl seiner Majestät stets vor dem Zugriff flinker Finger geschützt bleiben solle und darob außer Reichweite von Knaben und Mädchen aufzubewahren ist.",,16,b7/b70ef3e91e85de74edb8f1a253045cfa5a1a3c78.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/005/077/avatar/original/1539616312-27503257_2021828554768584_7474700925856298877_o.jpg,,Grüner Kaiser,0,0,gruner-kaiser,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/gruner-kaiser,,,,,,,,,,,,
5934,"Hanfprodukte erleben zurzeit einen regelrechten Boom – denn Hanf enthält als Heilpflanze viele Wirkstoffe.
 
So setzen immer mehr Menschen auf die positiven Eigenschaften des CBD in der Hanfpflanze: Es soll schmerzlindernd und entzündungshemmend wirken, bei Angstzuständen und Depressionen helfen und gestresste Nerven beruhigen. Wir sind keine Mediziner und unsere Produkte werden sicher nicht den Gang zum Arzt ersetzen. Dennoch glauben wir fest an die unbegrenzten Wirkstoffe der Hanfpflanze.
 
Wir bieten ausschließlich Ware mit sogenanntem CBD an. Dieses „Cannabidiol“ wird aus der Hanfpflanze gewonnen, ist aber im Gegensatz zum ebenfalls in Hanf enthaltenen Wirkstoff THC nicht psychoaktiv – und macht somit weder high noch süchtig! Keines unserer Produkte überschreitet den in Deutschland gesetzlich festgeschriebenen THC-Wert von 0,2% und ist somit legal erhältlich!
 
Wir legen größten Wert auf hochwertige Produkte und beziehen unsere Ware ausschließlich von renommierten Herstellern und Lieferanten. Keines unserer CBD Produkte hat chemische Inhaltsstoffe, alle sind zu 100 Prozent Bio und vegan.
 
Im Gegensatz zum Onlinehandel können dort viele Fragen direkt beantwortet werden. Wer zu uns in den Laden kommt, wird fachlich kompetent beraten und erhält alle relevanten Infos zur Hanfpflanze, zum Wirkstoff CBD und damit verbunden zu unseren Produkten.

7018,"Hanf im Glück wurde im Sommer 2018 von Ralf Kannheiser mit einer ambitionierten Vision gegründet: Eine der ältesten Nutzpflanzen der Welt sollte von ihrer sozialen Stigmatisierung befreit werden, damit auch die breite Gesellschaft im konservativsten Bundesland Deutschlands die gesundheitsfördernde Wirkung der Cannabis Pflanze für sich nutzen kann – und das ganz legal. 
 
 
 
So entstand die Idee, einen Laden im Herzen Münchens zu eröffnen, in dem sich Hanffreunde und interessierte Personen informieren, austauschen und mit erstklassigen Produkten eindecken können. Mit „Hanf im Glück“ wurde Münchens erster CBD Hanf Shop eröffnet, der bereits im ersten Jahr auf enormen Zuspruch durch die Bevölkerung von München und dessen Umland stieß. 
 
 
 
Bei der Auswahl unserer Produkte setzen wir stets auf allerhöchste Qualität. Der persönliche Austausch mit unseren Lieferanten sowie das direkte Feedback unserer Kunden bilden dabei die Basis unserer Arbeit, die wir fortlaufend optimieren möchten.

JustDab offers a selection of premium concentrates crafted from nugrun flowers cultivated indoors with entirely organic material. Enjoying a gob of JustDab delivers a robust cannabis experience. The JustDab line includes stable extractions that provide astonishing flavor and incredible effects. Crafted with techniques that preserve the essence of the strain JustDab's live resin cartridges, shatter, and batter express the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes, plus the plant’s lipids. When you want to enjoy connoisseur-grade concentrates, JustDab.
 
 
 
Process
 
The JustDab process is hinged on two philosophies; start pure and run precise. JustDab flowers are cultivated indoors at their state-of-the-art cannabis garden. Every aspect of the grow environment is meticulously controlled to ensure their extracts are derived from the most pristine cannabis flowers. Pesticides are never used in JustDab’s grow, and their master growers nurture their strains with organic nutrients to yield healthy, resinous buds.
 
 
 
“No trim, no shake, no BS.”
 
JustDab takes pride in their nugrun-only extraction. The flowers they use to craft their concentrates are whole buds that could otherwise be smoked on their own. Those buds are processed in a closed loop system with lab-grade hydrocarbons, free from harmful impurities. Refined light hydrocarbon extraction is regaled by concentrate connoisseurs everywhere for its ability to retain the most from the original plant. We aren’t just talking terpenes and cannabinoids here, the plant’s lipids are intact as well. The final product is pure, potent concentrates.
 
 
 
Products
 
You don’t need to re-introduce what is already there.
 
Vape on another level, JustDab places the essence of cannabis into your pocket. JustDab cartridges are filled with live-resin extracted concentrate derived from strain-specific nugrun flowers. JustDab does not re-introduce flavor or terpenes into their oils because their extraction technique preserves everything the starting material has to offer.

LITTO was founded with a mission to provide dope products that represent you and letting your voice be heard. They want viewers and users to get the authentic and honest feel for their brand without relying on the people behind LITTO for the personality of the brand. Instead, they allow their users to speak for them, show who they are, and what they represent. For example, when you look at their Instagram, (@itslitto), you see user submitted photos and genuine interactions. Taking the attention off of them as individuals, it puts the attention back on the product and allows them to focus on their users' satisfaction. They give their users the platform to communicate with them directly and offer suggestions. This personal level of engagement ensures LITTO is listening to all feedback and constantly improving their product. They want to create products that their users feel involved with and would want to repurchase, but also recommend to friends and family. When they began, their ultimate goal was to create a brand that people could identify with and feel was their own. Simply put, they’re a brand that’s striving to generate an open dialogue with their users and keep the dialogue flowing both ways at all times.

History
 
North County Pharms’ founder has been rooted in the cannabis industry for more than a decade, specializing in cultivation and genetic engineering. He entered the industry at a time when social acceptance was low, and stigmatization was high. The founder was persistent and saw the benefits of marijuana as unignorable. While operating Northstar Holistic Collective in Sacramento, he could not help but notice that patients could not get enough of his flowers. It was apparent that it was time to take his passion to the next level and put a brand name behind his buds. The result was North Country Pharms, a cannabusiness dedicated to cultivating premium strains of flower with terpene and cannabinoid profiles unlike any other. He proudly launched North Country Pharms in 2016, reintroducing the flowers that California knows and loves under a brand they can trust.
 
 
 
Process
 
North Country Pharms sources flower from their indoor cannabis garden and also procures strains from their network of grows throughout California. North Country Pharms only works with cultivators who employ the best practices. Each farm provides maximum quality control and cultivates without the use of pesticides. They grow with phenotype in mind, setting up each strain in the environment that nourishes the plant best. Then their flower is carefully harvested and cured to perfection -- ready to distribute.

Our premium cannabis oil and a proprietary blend of HTE and THCa diamonds are unrivaled in purity, quality, and potency. This commitment to excellence, combined with high-quality vaping hardware delivers a truly top-shelf experience.




 - Ocean Cannabis Co. Diamond Sauce vapes are THCa diamond-infused for high potency and sauce infused for great flavor. Each vape is made with live resin sauce, THCa diamond crystals, live resin cannabis terpenes, and pure THC concentrate oil providing you with a true dab-like experience. 




 - Ocean Cannabis Co. Discreet vapes are made with pure THC oil and all-natural plant-based terpenes for when you want a more discreet vaping experience or just a great quality high potency vape. These vapes taste GREAT but have little smell that dissipates quickly.










Our second mission is to tackle the problem of plastic waste that is polluting our oceans and destroying our planet. Over 8,000,000 metric tons of plastic enter our oceans every year which is the equivalent of a garbage truck filled with plastic being dumped into the ocean every minute! As a result, there is more micro-plastic in the ocean than there are stars in the Milky Way, killing more than one million seabirds and marine animals every year. Ocean Cannabis Co. is committed to saving the Big Blue by truly “going green”. 

 

By sourcing our packaging from 100% reclaimed and recycled ocean plastic, each purchase of an Ocean Cannabis Co. vape recovers the equivalent weight of 10 drinking straws or one water bottle’s worth of plastic from our oceans. When you buy Ocean Cannabis Co products, you help clean the ocean and protect the earth! 

 

When we started Ocean Cannabis Co., we wanted to meet the need for premium, natural cannabis developed with a commitment to quality and sustainability that only a family business can provide. From our family to yours - Join us in the fight to rid the ocean of plastic, one amazing vape at a time. Let’s smoke the ocean clean!

Odo Oil - Spokane, Washington’s World-Class CO2 Concentrates
 
 
 
With Odo Oil, Washington finally has a cannabis brand dedicated to providing the highest quality concentrates to the cannabis community. Utilizing cutting edge CO2 extraction techniques, Odo Oil provides pure and clean oils and cartridges for new patients and savvy concentrate connoisseurs alike. By applying an artist’s creative approach with a scientist’s innovative touch, Odo Oil has created concentrates that are guaranteed to be the “softest dab” you’ve ever had.
 
History:
 
TThe founder of Odo Oil came from a family with medical roots in the Washington community. Through years of working and communicating with patients throughout Washington, he realized that cannabis oils weren’t being utilized as proper medicine, and when they were, the product was being made at subpar standards. Knowing full well the importance of providing pure and clean medicine to patients suffering from all sorts of ailments, he knew he could do better. In 2016 he created Odo Oil and introduced their products to the medical and cannabis community. Striving to make concentrates completely free of solvents, the Odo Oil team is proud to provide concentrates patients can put into their bodies without having the risk of consuming contaminates or impurities when they medicate. As they began to work with more medical marijuana dispensaries and develop new products, Odo Oil has had the pleasure of advancing the Washington cannabis community to its fullest potential.
 
Process:
 
Using a proprietary CO2 extraction method unlike any other, Odo Oil is able to innovatively retain every single terpene naturally found in the cannabis plant without introducing solvents to the process. Determined not to compromise the integrity of the marijuana plant, Odo Oil products are 100% solventless and genuine to the strain it derives from originally.
 
Products:
 
Specializing in oil concentrates, Odo Oil prides themselves on providing helping patients get the medicine their after, no matter the form. Coming in both cartridges and oils, Odo Oil’s CO2 Honey Oil, CO2 Nectar, and Flavor Nectar are made using their 100% solvent free proprietary system. The CO2 Nectar keeps the terpenes and delicious flavors from the original plant, making it one of the most savory and soft dabs you can lay your lips on.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Transparency is the name of the game when it comes to Odo Oil’s commitment to providing the cleanest cannabis medicine. Testing with Trace Analytics, the first 502 laboratory in the entire state of Washington, Odo Oil tests cannabis flower for pesticides before extraction. Once they have extracted they test products again for potency, full microbial assessment, and residual solvents. They proudly provide lab results to every single dispensary carrying Odo Oil products.
 
Networks:
 
Odo Oil is honored to work with the cannabis and medical community in Washington. They’ve partnered with local growers Green Zone in Yakima, Washington for their whole plant flower. Odo Oil products can be found in several prominent dispensaries, including Satori, Smokane, and Lucky Leaf in Spokane, 420 Carpenter and 420 West in Olympia, White Rabbit in Lynnwood, and many other clinics throughout the state of Washington.",,83,1d/1d8907a2c8d88432a681b3a8355fe8aaf3dbf3b8.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/030/avatar/original/1516660719-ODO_Basic_Logo_Square.jpg,,ODO Co2 Extracts,5,2,odo-fine-oil-inc,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/odo-fine-oil-inc,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is Rosin?
 
​​
 
The first hash makers date back over 1,000 years with hash itself possessing a deep, global history. Although terminology has changed over time, the original name for hash comes from the Arabic word ( حشيش ), which means grass. Hashish making is an art form that has been passed from artisan to apprentice for centuries, originating from Asia and the Middle East.
 
​​Traditionally hash had been made either by hand with pressure and heat. Pressing that hash into rosin is just the next step that we and others are now taking. While the demand for rosin has grown dramatically over the past year, hash rosin’s reputation in particular as the ultra premium concentrate is also making major headway among true connoisseurs. Due its truly solvent-less profile, hash rosin is frequently regarded as the purest full melt concentrate right alongside full melt hash itself. With BHO and solvent-based extraction, you can blast low quality material into golden shatter, however with rosin, there’s no way to remove impurities — so what you see is what you get.​
 
 
 
Terpene content is also consistently excellent with hash rosin, which many cannabis aficionados consider to be the cardinal quality concentrates. With proper equipment and techniques, the terpene content of hash rosin can naturally reach and exceed 10% weight by volume. The best of the best rosin is known as “live rosin”, which means that fresh frozen plant material is first washed into hash and then pressed into rosin to produce a higher yielding and more potent concentrate. It’s typically known as “full spectrum” because when hash is derived from freshly frozen cannabis it offers a full complement of cannabinoids and terpenes.
 
​
 
As a result, many solvent-based extractions can’t claim “full spectrum” because so many terpenes and cannabinoids can be lost in the process. Against a flooded market of low quality BHO and questionable vape pens, rosin’s popularity is expected to increase sharply given its small batch, labor-of-love style of production. If you ask any true cannabis lover what they’re always on the lookout for, chances are they’ll rank hash rosin right next to or above live resin....",,15,0e/0e2becb738aecc37550c2fe1218995d3a9ee8763.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/009/864/avatar/original/1586303745-rsz_ok_rosin_logo-.png,,OK Rosin,0,0,ok-rosin,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/ok-rosin,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embracing wellness while rooted in science, OutCo delivers the highest quality products that support customer, partner, and community needs. As an industry pioneer, OutCo sets a new standard for cultivation, extraction, formulation and research.
 
OutCo Grown
OutCo utilizes both indoor and outdoor cultivation methods, striving to produce the best quality flower. Purity and sustainability are the foundation of our gardens. With customized nutrient formulas and industry-leading growing techniques, our team delivers truly superior cannabis. Because all finished products require the best starting material, OutCo grown harvests undergo rigorous quality control inspections. This level of care is preserved during the extraction and formulation processes for which OutCo is known.

OutCo Extracted 
Exploring the science behind the selectivity of CO2, we are able to target which constituents of the cannabis plant we do want to extract, while minimizing the transfer of elements we don't. Our optimized parameters allow us to precisely capture the natural terpenes produced by cannabis. Through selective extraction, we can target cannabinoids while minimizing lipid and chlorophyll content. This eliminates the need for winterization and distillation allowing for a true-to-flower extract enriched in all the minor cannabinoids and essential oils found naturally produced in the plant.

OutCo Formulated 
The formulation practices at OutCo make use of minimally refined cannabis extracts to deliver highly refined user experiences. We prioritize maintaining the full chemical complexity of the cannabis plant while combining our extracts with all-natural ingredients that enhance the therapeutic efficacy of these synergistic molecules. Our unique, industry leading practices allow us to offer thoughtfully designed formulations with mindfully sourced materials to create products you can feel good about using.",,763,5e/5e59678ddb5628543107b10633d61bb6d829a4f0.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/435/avatar/original/1586448994-image0.png,https://www.instagram.com/outco.brand,OutCo,4.27857160568237,31,outco,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/outco,https://www.outco.com,,,,,,,,,,,

Pacific Frost Farms is your source of premium cannabis flowers cultivated with the highest quality control and attention to detail. Named “Frost” for a reason, Pacific Frost Farms yield buds with glistening, resinous trichomes. The team believes in the benefits of cannabis and strive to make clean, safe, and potent buds available to folks throughout Oregon.
 
 
 
Pacific Frost Farms know their buds, not only are they lab tested but genetically analyzed to guarantee the cultivar has the proper strain name. The team believes education is vital and aims to connect with as many curious tokers they can through every channel available.
 
 
 
History
 
The Pacific Frost Farms team are longstanding cannabis advocates and master growers. Each believes in the benefits of medical cannabis as an alternative medicine and always felt a toke among friends for fun was better than a drink. They longed to get premium cannabis flowers into the hands of those in need and banned together to operate a pristine garden with respect to the plant. Once their frosty buds were ready for smoking, the team was prepared to reveal their brand. Pacific Frost Farms launched in November 2015.
 
 
 
Process
 
Pacific Frost Farms flowers are cultivated indoors, giving the master growers complete quality control. Overseeing every input, the team provides each cultivar what it needs to thrive. Once their buds are ready for harvest they are carefully collected and cured to perfection.
 
 
 
Products
 
For the best GSC flowers on the market, Pacific Frost Farms has you covered. GSC is loved for her sweet terpene profile and powerful effects and Pacific Frost Farms does these buds justice. Her nugs are densely blanketed in trichomes and sends rich cookies flavor and profound euphoria with every toke.

Papa knew everybody and everybody knew Papa. He was the kind of guy you couldn’t help but like - a big personality with a big heart. Papa always remembered your name. And when you needed weed, he’d hook you up. He always had a stash of the good stuff. Papa just loved to share the happiness. So here’s to Papa. He’s always sharing the good times.

857,"Who we are:

As the founder of Paradise Seeds, I have always been highly involved in the breeding of our beloved cannabis varieties. Since we started growing cannabis in the early 1980’s, it has always been our aim to select the very best genetics. This has resulted in a solid strain base which is the cornerstone of work. Only selecting and crossing the most potent cannabis (marijuana) plants with the finest, sweet taste has led to the creation of the powerful connoisseur strains we offer today. The quality you get with our cannabis seeds is that of the finest cannabis currently available on the market.

We are in the privileged position of having a great test ground in Europe. Here, we can test and select the best genetics the plant world has to offer. If you have some unique and/or mind-blowing genetics of your own that you would like to share with us, you can send seeds or clones to our office in Holland. We would be honoured to test them! Indeed, we may use them in our future breeding projects so that your genetics can find their way to other cannabis growers around the world.

How we work:

Our cannabis seeds are organically produced and contain all the necessary trace elements for a good start. We work with strict criteria regarding the pollination of our plants. Our pollination rooms are secure so that no stray pollen from other male plants can find their way into our select stock. Pollen filters are used in all our grow rooms. As the moment of pollination is very important, we carefully schedule all pollinations to prevent seeds of inferior quality. After the production of seeds, we select only the best seeds by hand, and leave out the premature and non-fertile ones. We then test these seeds on viability and germination. This way we can guarantee you will always get fresh, living seeds that are sure to grow top-quality plants.

Paradise Seeds guarantees a 95% germination rate, if the growing conditions are right. See our cannabis grow info page to read about the best conditions to germinate cannabis seeds.

About the quality of our cannabis seeds:

The cannabis seeds you get from Paradise are the real deal! They will produce the exact same quality strains you can read about in our descriptions and see in our photos for that specific variety. We don’t sell second-best. Some people believe that the cannabis seeds they buy are not originals. This may be true of some seed vendors who sell copies of renowned strains. But you can be assured that from us, you will receive genuine seeds that are the very same we have used to win numerous cannabis cups over the years!

More then 25 cups have been won by Paradise Seeds in several cannabis cups since 1999, as well as some honourable mentions, such as Plant of the Year 2003 for Sensi Star (High Times magazine). This is why we proudly state that from our seeds you can obtain end products of the finest potency, taste and quality. Cannabis cups are not the only proof of this – so are the hundreds of customer reports we receive each year that speaking highly of our cannabis strains.

Most of our varieties are strong, vigorous F1 cannabis hybrids, the result of crossing stable strains. These strains are developed to grow indoors, except for Sweet-purple, which was produced especially to grow outdoors in colder and humid regions. However, listening to the experience of many cannabis (marijuana) growers, we know they also perform great indoors or in a greenhouse. The other varieties can be grown outdoors in milder, sunnier regions, like France, Italy or Spain. In the varieties descriptions you can read the approximate harvest time when grown under the sun.

Delta(9)tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the main active ingredient of cannabis which provides the pleasant mind and body sensation described as a “high” or “buzz”. The higher the level of THC in a plant, the stronger its active effect. The given THC percentages are estimations. Since the plants are never grown under exactly the same conditions, the THC percentage can differ even in the same strains, but should always range between the given estimations for that particular strain. The highest THC percentage can be achieved from plants grown in optimum conditions.

Also the size/shape of the buds and the yield can vary from time to time. The aroma and taste are also subject to change, all depending largely on the growing conditions. If the grower tends the garden with love and dedication, he or she will harvest fruity, tasty top-quality buds.",https://www.facebook.com/paradiseseedsofficial/,114,21/21826d1ebb01d8744f59a096585347f7b7fd5370.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/857/avatar/original/Paradise_Seeds_logo.jpg,paradiseseeds,Paradise Seeds,5,1,paradise-seeds-bv,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/paradise-seeds-bv,https://www.paradise-seeds.com,,,,,,,,,,,

18475,"We pride ourselves on being pioneers of the biggest cannabis pheno-hunt in Michigan, creating multiple proprietary strains that simply don’t exist anywhere else. We searched through 60 plants within 12 harvested strains to find those with the most exceptional qualities, including potency, resin production, weight, aroma and flavor. It’s a painstaking selection process that takes a minimum of three months and yields the best quality – what we call the Ferrari of cannabis. Where most farms will test, develop and breed the best plant from just one proprietary clone, Pegasus goes infinitely further to develop new strains. Our dedicated master cultivators are expert artisans who are passionate about their craft and know it deeply. We clone all our products and from those clones, breed and pollinate other flowers in a delicately refined process to develop genetic profiles that articulate an emotional experience. We look at the attributes and genetic profiles, know what we want to be dominant, fold them and breed them to create our Pegasus cuts and proprietary strains – our Pegasus Genetics. Sure, it takes about 18 months to do it well, but that meticulous research and development ensures we have the best cut and unsurpassed quality you’ll recognize over and over again. As it says on our facility door, “Quality is not an act, it is a habit.” We agree, Aristotle.",,32,81/81c360a6cb56c01ded53410f6a38a747369ea97b.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/018/475/avatar/original/1641672193-pegasus_logo_line-7.jpg,,Pegasus Green,0,0,pegasus-green-llc,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/pegasus-green-llc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perecan Farm LLC provides premium cannabis oil to all Seattle and Washington state. As a cannabis company that believes in the importance of providing a moral, ethical product, Perecan Farm LLC utilizes the therapeutic benefits of traditional Chinese medicine with the scientific approach of cannabis cultivation, extraction, and production. Perecan Farm LLC strives to do well by doing good.
 
History:
 
The founding couple behind Perecan Farm LLC were introduced to the cannabis community due to necessity. When one of the founder’s father grew ill, she began to help him find medical alternatives to his symptoms. As Chinese natives, they respected traditional Chinese medical practices, exploring herbal medicines and eventually cannabis. While they found cannabis to be a natural, therapeutic remedy for his condition, his lungs were weak, a result of years of inhaling pollution, and smoking cannabis wasn’t a comfortable way to medicate. The founder and her sister put their heads together and collaborated on creating a product that their father could use to medicate. Drawing on their vast education and knowledge (one has a Masters In Electrical Engineering, the other a Masters in Chemistry), the sisters produced a concentrate that was pure, potent, and smooth enough for their father to use. When their father began to improve, he became a strong supporter of community-based events.
 
And Perecan Farm LLC was born. As they continued to refine and improve their extraction techniques, they developed strong feelings toward the communities of patients looking for pure, effective, and affordable medical products. Perecan Farm LLC made it their calling to use cannabis to provide patients with those products.
 
Process:
 
Perecan Farm LLC makes incredible Honey Comb and Dab Oil using CO2 extraction methods only. Using CO2 and their developed method of extraction allows them to honor the Chinese medicine tradition of avoiding all unnatural substances. With no solvents or hydrocarbons, they manufacture products free of PG, VG, PEG, fillers, or foreign substances. Tirelessly working to ensure absolute product safety and a high level of quality, every concentrate must live up to their standards. Otherwise, it doesn’t go in the package. Perecan Farm LLC take pride in proving the cleanest extract possible.
 
Products:
 
Perecan Farm LLC produce top shelf and pure CO2 Honey Comb and Hash Oil. They utilize strains that customers and patients love, including Blueberry, Cinex, Cross Fire, and more.",,32,1b/1b211f6da82d5de7bc4ed8d558874de5acae6b2f.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/233/avatar/original/perecan-logo.jpg,,Perecan,3.66666674613953,2,perecan,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/perecan,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other edibles cannot replicate the love, care, and attention to detail found in Mimi’s IncrEdibles line of cannabis-infused desserts. Mimi’s IncrEdibles bring artistry to the marijuana industry with her adorably crafted marijuana treats, complete with the decorative embellishment Mimi envisions in her mind. Mimi is the queen of crafting treats that look good, taste great, and feel even better. Mimi’s IncrEdibles cute concoctions are the crossroads of her imagination and what patients want most from an edible.
 
History:
 
Mimi’s IncrEdibles began two and a half years ago out of the desperate need of quality edibles in the Inland Empire area. One day, Mimi’s husband, a dispensary owner, suggested for her to start baking marijuana-infused confections. From there Mimi got to work on experimenting with edibles, which shaped the customer driven line of products Mimi’s IncrEdibles features today. Patients were consistently amazed by the hard-hitting effects, as her products have no taste of marijuana in them. The positive feedback and patient requests have Mimi’s IncrEdibles very excited for their future in marijuana. Mimi continues to strive for the best in each of her cannabis products, listening closely to her customers’ feedback and fulfilling requests for one of a kind marijuana-infused delicacies.
 
Process:
 
Made by hand with gourmet ingredients, and shaped entirely by customer feedback, Mimi’s IncrEdibles has gotten the art of edible making down. Mimi’s IncrEdibles does not skimp on their ingredients, using organic products, and specialty chocolates to develop their delicious menu.
 
Mimi warns all of her patients: Eat, Keep, Wait, Repeat. Start slowly with a 5 to 10mg dose for folks that aren’t experienced with edible cannabis. Safe keeping is next, make sure all marijuana products are stored in their original container. And the hardest part for most people is: wait. Mimi’s IncrEdibles are quite potent, and customers should wait at least two hours before considering increasing their dosage. And then, repeat!
 
Products:
 
Mimi’s IncrEdibles has the goods to satisfy every sweet tooth; with classic marijuana treats such as a variety of brownies, cereal treats, cookies, cupcakes, muffins, cake pops and monkey bread. Mimi makes rich, decadent brownies including Oreo Double Chocolate Brownie and Peanut Butter stuffed Brownie. Cereal treats are available in Trix, Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, Cap’n Crunch, Fruity Pebbles and many more. Pop-off a good time with Mimi’s IncrEdibles Soft Caramel Snickerdoodle Cookie, or with her Nutella Stuffed Chocolate Chip Muffin. No matter what patients choose from Mimi’s IncrEdibles, it is sure to be a one of a kind and made with love.

Lab Testing:

The company founders have each more than 15 years of experience in this field. Our breeders have cooperated or worked for the most famous seedbanks of this industry, and we have production and test rooms in 3 different countries.
 
After many years in the global market, Ministry of Cannabis is a recognised breeder of premium quality marijuana seeds (aka weed seeds or pot seeds).
 
Our ambition is to offer you the level of excellence that you deserve. Our project always follows two main lines: one is to keep the availability of the classical cannabis strains (i.e. White Widow) in female form.
 
The other is to make available the new strains that each breeder develops during the years. From our effort, we are proud to introduce to the market new strains like Carnival and Zensation.
 
Since 2008 we have introduced our line of autoflowering seeds, in regular and feminized form. Since january 2009 we sell only feminized seeds.
 
Beyond expanding our seeds range offer, we offer a customer service with great attention to each customer, private or company, little or big. Making the world greener is a game that we can only win together.
 
Since 01 january 2014 we closed our main office in Amsterdam and we operate from our new office in the center of the city of Barcelona, while the production of the seeds stays in The Netherlands (feminized) and Spain (autoflowering).

La primera, es la de mantener una disponibilidad continua de variedades clásicas de cannabis (por ejemplo, la variedad White Widow) en su línea femenina. La otra es la de ofrecer nuevas variedades que cada cultivador ha desarollado a lo largo de los años. A partir de éste esfuerzo, estamos muy orgullosos de haber introducido en el mercado nuevas variedades como la Carnival y la Zensation.
 
A partir del año 2008, ofrecimos nuestra línea de semillas de autofloración, tanto regulares como femenizadas. Desde el año 2009 vendemos solamente semillas feminizadas.

408,"Mother Humboldt’s products were developed over the last 5 years by Barbara Hagopian as an alternative method for relieving acute/chronic pain. Suffering from chronic pain for over 12 years, Barbara found that prescription medications were too hard on her body.
 
Amazingly, Barbara had a background as an herbal alchemist, studying and experimenting with herbs for over 40 years. Out of sheer desperation to relieve her own chronic pain, Barbara decided to use her specialized herbalist knowledge to create an effective, all natural, and organic topical pain reliever. She experimented with medicinal herbs and other all natural organic oils and compounds targeted specifically for pain relief, and the results of the final product were far more effective than she had hoped for. Due to the progression and severity of her illness, Barbara was unable to continue the manufacture and sales of Mother Humboldt’s.
 
So in 2013, Daniel Phillips, MSW, took over Mother Humboldt’s as sole proprietor. Daniel is a Medical Social Worker with over 23 years of experience in health care. He is passionate about this product because, like Barbara, managing chronic pain is his daily feat. In 2014, Daniel asked long time friend and colleague Mark Kalemos, LCSW, to join the Mother Humboldt’s team as partner. Mark is also a Medical Social Worker with over 23 years of experience as a health care professional.
 
Together, Daniel and Mark formed Mother Humboldt’s Inc., a medical non-profit corporation. Using this product over the years, many people have reported significant pain relief from a wide range of conditions, including, but not limited to: arthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, gout, fibromyalgia, neuralgia, shingles, restless leg syndrome, cancer, burns, bruising, menstrual cramps, and general muscle aches and spasms.",,42,5e/5e88894f17a7f84079333fabd9d1637767343c3a.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/408/avatar/original/MHBlogo.jpg,,Mother Humboldts Inc.,4.66666650772095,1,mother-humboldts,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/mother-humboldts,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have you ever experienced the natural blissful feeling after satisfying a “chocolate craving?”

Anandamide, known as the “bliss molecule,” is found in chocolate and can explain that euphoric feeling after consumption. It is also a natural endocannabinoid that binds to THC and cannabinoid receptors. Can you imagine the bliss of combining chocolate and cannabinoids without sugar and calories?

Mountain High Suckers rises above the rest for one reason: they keep things simple. Producing handmade suckers and lozenges for nearly ten years, Mountain High Suckers boldly experiments with flavors and continually strives to stay ahead of the infused hard candy competition. Mountain High Suckers’ years of consistent genetics, precise dosages, and lab tested excellence offers patients and recreational consumers alike a scrumptiously powerful cannabis experience without fail.
 
History:
 
Founded in 2009, the caregivers and growers behind Mountain High Suckers began crafting cannabis-infused suckers out of their home and selling them to medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado. The candies were a hit, and as they found more and more success, Mountain High Suckers began to grow with the emerging Colorado cannabis industry steadily. They adapted as new regulations were introduced, pioneered the CBD market before anyone else, and expanded to larger facilities and experimented with new flavors all while staying true to their core mission of helping people. Today, Mountain High Suckers celebrates nearly ten years of excellence with many celebrity-inspired hard candy lines, dozens of infused cannabis flavors, and distribution across Colorado and soon both the United States and the world.
 
Process:
 
As Mountain High Suckers started out serving medical patients, consistent and potent dosing is always of utmost importance. They begin with their in-house cultivated cannabis, growing in perfectly controlled quality conditions to yield the ideal source material. They utilize whole-plant ethanol extraction, utterly purging their content of residual solvents and employing the entirety of the plant's medicinal benefits and cannabinoids in their candies. Mountain High Suckers then evenly distributes the cannabis concentrate evenly across the candy, creating equal servings across the board on which users can rely. The final product is delicious, reliably potent and affordable hard candies offering consistent excellence with every taste.
 
Products:
 
Mountain High Suckers produces a variety of flavors, cannabinoid ratios, and potencies of lozenges and suckers. Starting with their Crazy Kush cannabis flower as a source, they craft their flavors ranging from Caramel Apple to Watermelon. With a ratio of THC: CBD of 3:1, Mountain High Suckers offer medicinal benefits in addition to their recreational value. Their simple processes allow Mountain High Suckers to keep their prices low and accessible, passing on as many savings as possible to their valued customers.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Mountain High Suckers has tested every batch of hash oil they’ve made since 2010 before Colorado’s regulations demanded it. Working with Agricor, they check for potency, pesticides, and residual solvents to ensure the strength and purity of their hard candies.
 
Networks:
 
Patients and recreational users can find Mountain High Suckers across Colorado, as well as in Las Vegas, where they rank as one of the city’s top-selling edibles.",,1171,89/898c2ad094a4c48d43236031753013745bb74cc7.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/488/avatar/original/1510179268-MHS-logo.jpg,,Mountain High Suckers,4.5,2,mountain-high-suckers,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/mountain-high-suckers,,,,,,,,,,,,

History

The founders of Mystery Baking are long-standing cannabis advocates and patients. They entered the cannabis industry while operating a dispensary and cultivation back in 2010. They began to make canna-budder and edibles out of their flowers, and sold their products to other dispensaries in the area. Patients loved their delicious edibles and after awhile of being in the dispensary business they decided to root themselves deeper into the cannabis community by organizing and planning events, concerts and shows, exhibiting the talent marijuana enthusiasts possess. In 2017, they were inspired to change their direction and get into producing premium quality edibles that allow patients to choose how they medicate.

 

The Mystery Baking team quit their day jobs and went all in! 

Crafting delicious and accurately dosed infused edibles while also managing the brand and everyday operations.

Their teamwork resulted in a line of best-in-class marijuana edibles that could serve as ingredients to a culinary creation or be enjoyed on their own. The team is comprised of long-time friends, and that spirit shows through their brand. To this day, the Mystery Baking team still goes hard -- and thanks to the fruits of their labor of love for the 420 community, they can also become cannabis chefs of their own.

 

Process

Consistency and quality are paramount to the Mystery Baking team, and each step of their process ensures patients and adult users get the same experience each time. They begin with organically grown, pesticide-free San Fernando Valley OG flowers from their cannabis garden. Those top-shelf buds are then processed with CO2 extraction to yield clean, potent, and active cannabinoid distillate. Then they use their magic, infusing their line of delectable ingredients with their premium SFV OG distillate.

Natural Stress Solutions believes there is a better, cleaner, and all-natural way for people to achieve relief and wellness. That solution is CBD, and the Natural Stress Solutions team are dedicated to providing the highest-quality CBD products available.
 
Everyone's body and ailments are unique, and so are Natural Stress Solutions’ products. They offer CBD isolate, as well as products with the full-spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes. Check out the Natural Stress Solutions’ menu to find your solution — nature is the answer.
 
History
 
Natural Stress Solutions stems from several years of experience and a desire to provide the absolute best for Michigan medical cannabis patients. Eric Jenkins was a longstanding medical cannabis advocate, and as more research about CBD began to surface, hemp took center stage of his focus.
 
Eric couldn’t help but notice the lack of CBD products available, and what was out there lacked accessibility on multiple levels. Eric built his company from the ground up and took on every compliance and access challenge head-on. He wanted his products to be something anyone can use, not just for those already acclimated to medical cannabis. He also wanted to create products with the full-spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes of the hemp plant for maximum effectiveness.
 
In early 2018, Eric was ready to unveil his line of premium CBD-infused products and launched Natural Stress Solutions. He remains a longstanding medical cannabis advocate.
 
Process
 
Natural Stress Solutions derives all of their CBD products from pure hemp flowers, cultivated in Kentucky. Then the most desirable characteristics of the strain are isolated with extraction, leaving the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes. From there, that THC-free concentrate is blended into each tincture and topical and lab tested for quality assurance.
 
Lab Testing
 
Natural Stress Solutions lab tests their products at multiple stages of development. First, the raw hemp material is tested then Natural Stress Solutions sends the final product to The Spott Laboratory for its last screening. Natural Stress Solutions products are full panel examined, from cannabinoids and terpenes to residual solvents and contaminants.",,99,45/45818381ac9e3e35854ec670238260999b74f9cf.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/973/avatar/original/1518726850-NATURAL-SRESS-LOGO.jpg,,Natural Stress Solutions,5,0,natural-stress-solutions,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/natural-stress-solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,

As it grows, thehempplant passes through a process of photosynthesis: CO2is absorbed and combines with hydrogen present in the plant to create carboxylic acid. This process is known as carboxylation.
 
The main carboxylic acidof our interestis CBDA, the precursor to CBD. As the plant grows, it only contains CBDA and not CBD. Decarboxylation is a chemical reaction in which the carboxyl group COOH is eliminated, in the form of H20 and CO2(water and carbon dioxide).
 
To make it simpler, decarboxylation is the process that consists of heating hemp to activate CBD and other cannabinoids.However, Natureight uses a decarboxylation processbelow 120ºC to avoid any degradation of the molecules present in the extract.
 
Like other cannabinoids, CBDA has no psychoactive effect and plays its role in the Entourage Effect. Previously considered inactive,several recent studies have examined the potential advantages of CBDA and have discovered in it, among other beneficial properties, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferating ones.
 
FULL SPECTRUM PLANT EXTRACTS
 
For the development ofourfood supplements, we have chosen to work with full spectrum extracts of thehempplant.
 
This is because other active ingredients of the plant improve the therapeutic effects of CBD. This is what is called theEntourage Effect.This can be compared to the biological effect of yeast. In cannabinoids this is produced by the rest of the molecules that accompany them in the original plant form (e.g. other cannabinoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.).
 
A complete spectrum extract containing CBD is thus incomparably more effective than CBD alone (as in pure CBD crystal) andallows totake advantage of all the benefits of the plant used in medicine for thousands of years.
 
LABORATORY TESTED
 
Allourhempextracts used by Natureight are tested by an independent laboratory. This involves checking the concentrations of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, etc. to guarantee high quality products that are in compliance with European regulations.
 
Natureight has also the HACCP certification. This is an internationally recognized risk management tool that allows for the optimum and responsible management of food graded security.

Nexus Cannabis Co. proudly crafts cannabis cartridges that deliver a dab-like experience. NCC oils contain the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes for a vaping experience that mirrors the essence of the original strain. Nexus Cannabis Co. specializes in high terpene and live resin extractions, encased in an easy to vape cartridge. Nexus Cannabis Co.’s founder is on a mission to bring taste into the cannabis scene, and aims to inspire the covetting of terpenes. For nug run flavor and powerful potency, look no further than Nexus Cannabis Co.
 
 
 
History
 
Nexus Cannabis Co. is the result of several threads of interest coming together to create a cannabusiness with their finger on the pulse of the LA’s 420-friendly. Mike opened a medical cannabis dispensary in 2009, where his knowledge and enthusiasm served him well. The cannabis community throughout the Los Angeles area loved his products and service, but Mike was a man of multiple interests, and a drive to pursue them all. He became an extractor with Crown Extracts. Through Crown Extracts, Mike learned how to extract high-quality live resin and crystalline and was able to perfect his skills as an extraction artist.
 
 
 
Mike decided to venture out on his own, taking the Nexus name through many evolutions. He started with Nexus Glass in 2013, a company that crafted specialty bongs and rigs. As time progressed, his glass art opened an opportunity to create a swanky hangout in Downtown Los Angeles. In 2015 Mike opened Nexus Social Lounge, residing on the border of Little Tokyo and the heart of Downtown.
 
 
 
After two successful cannabis-adjacent businesses and one extraction company, Mike was ready to take his passion for marijuana to the next level. He wanted to create a vape cartridge that brought full-spectrum flavor and effects in every drag and knew that distillate would never do the trick. To reach the level of potency he was aiming for, Mike needed to bring live resin into cartridges. The result was a menu of mighty vape pens filled with premium concentrate that delivers the essence of the strain in every puff. Nexus Cannabis Co. launched in 2016, Mike and his team have happily produced and served fire ever since.
 
 
 
Process
 
Nexus Cannabis Co. source their flowers from a combination of their in-house gardens and other well known, high-quality cultivators. Every bud used for extraction grow without pesticides or Plant Growth Regulators and are nurtured in their ideal environment. From there, nug run flowers are frozen, sealing the trichomes at their peak freshness and locking in the cannabinoids and terpenes of the strain. The cannabinoids and terpenes of those fresh frozen flowers are isolated into a concentrate and placed into cartridges for your vaping enjoyment.
 
 
 
Products
 
No matter the cartridge, full spectrum flavor and effects are sure to follow with every drag of a Nexus Cannabis Co. vape. They offer delicious options such as their Gushers Sauce Pen, a cartridge that captures the essence of the Gushers strain. Gushers are the result of parent strains Gelato #41 x Triangle Kush, and thanks to her Girl Scout Cookies genetics offer a terpene profile that delivers sugary sensations in every puff.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
The safety and efficacy of Nexus Cannabis Co. products are of the utmost importance to their team, which is why they are proud to offer lab tested vape oils provided by SC Labs. Their extractions are screened for residual solvents, pesticides, terpene, and cannabinoid content.",,261,b3/b311eb765bb7582373c93ae835dd40644a9fa8f6.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/730/avatar/original/1536798336-0.jpg,,Nexus Cannabis Co.,4.93103456497192,22,nexus-cannabis-co,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/nexus-cannabis-co,,,,,,,,,,,,

Process:
 
As they’ve done for decades, Lotus Family Farms raise their cannabis crops using entirely organic and sustainable methods. Instead of importing soil, fertilizer, and seeds, the growers create their soil, feed their cannabis with live microbe-based food and produce their dirt and compost from the land. With an eye for breeding, Lotus Family Farms traces their seeds back years of growing seasons to optimize for top medicinal value. Following harvest, they work with partners who carefully non-decarboxylate the plant to create products rich with terpenes, THCA, and other cannabinoids, ensuring patients and consumers taste the full cannabis experience. Grown in the sun, their craft cannabis continues to delight the palates of consumers across Oregon, offering a pure seed to table marijuana encounter with every bud.
 
Products:
 
Lotus Family Farms breeds a variety of high-class strains, with a mixture of commercial favorites, traditional classics, and unique in-house genetic favorites. Their flowers sport beautiful colors and rich trichomes, easily identifiable by their distinct aromas and textures. Patients and consumers alike love their Purple Lotus, Sgt. Stan Danko, Lotus Skunk, and Scary Berry strains, all crafted in house with strong effects and plentiful terpenes. Lotus Family Farms also grows local favorites, including Oregon OG Kush, K.C. 33 Mango Kush, and the classic Blue Dream among plenty others on their immense farmland. In 2017, they plan on releasing in-house seed strains to the market for others to spread the love.
 
Lab Testing:
 
All cannabis plants at Lotus Family Farms undergo lab testing in cannabinoid profile, potency, terpene content, mold, pesticides, mildew and more, to offer their customers absolute peace of mind that their growing processes are 100% organic. They collaborate with Green Leaf Laboratories and Cascadia Labs to ensure the highest quality of medical marijuana reaches Oregon dispensaries.

2485,"Love CBD is a small family-run business located in Newmarket, Suffolk. We started selling CBD oil in late 2014, before it became the big deal it is today. This was a passion project from the beginning: we saw what was happening in the USA, where state by state CBD was being legalised, and we didn’t think it was fair that people in the UK should be deprived access to equally high quality cannabis oil.

At that time, most of the UK CBD oils being sold were made from industrial hemp waste. We were determined to do better. We began hunting for suppliers around Europe who could produce CBD oil made from hemp flowers and grown with the specific intention of becoming CBD oil.

Two years (and much hard work) later, The Love CBD Range has become established as a leading brand for CBD oil, CBD balm and CBD spray in the UK.

We are proud of our products… but more than that, we are proud to have played a role in the CBD and cannabis revolution that is taking place worldwide. Change is coming and laws will change.


Love CBD es una pequeña empresa familiar ubicada en Newmarket, Suffolk. Comenzamos a vender petróleo CBD a finales de 2014, antes de que se convirtiera en el gran negocio que es hoy. Este fue un proyecto de pasión desde el principio: vimos lo que estaba pasando en Los Estados Unidos, donde se estaba legalizando la CDB estatal y no creíamos que fuera justo que las personas en el Reino Unido tuvieran acceso privado al aceite de cannabis de igual calidad. 
 
En ese momento, la mayor parte de los aceites CBD del Reino Unido que se vendían se fabricaban a partir de desechos industriales de cáñamo. Estábamos decididos a hacerlo mejor. Comenzamos a buscar proveedores de toda Europa que pudieran producir aceite de CBD a partir de flores de cáñamo y cultivado con la intención específica de convertirse en aceite de CBD. 

Estamos orgullosos de nuestros productos ... pero más que eso, estamos orgullosos de haber jugado un papel en la CBD y la revolución del cannabis que está teniendo lugar en todo el mundo.

11648,"Our mission is to craft fine cannabis flowers and bring them to market in a safe, sustainable, and responsible way. We envision a cannabis industry that is driven by quality craft products produced by all communities, for all communities. LOWD™ provides unmatched value to our partners and consumers who can expect professional service and consistently excellent products, without sacrificing ethics.




Our founders spent decades sampling landrace strains and popular crosses from all across the world. They each started growing in their basement in the early 2000s during the medical cannabis revolution. Seeing a lack of legacy growers and pioneers leading the industry, they joined together to form a company that represents Pacific Northwestern Urban cannabis culture.




Each of the strains offered at LOWD™ was selected and approved by Jesce Horton and Dave Murray, with the goal of offering their favorite genetics to fellow cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts. Our gardeners focus 100% of their time and effort into plant health maintenance. LOWD’s crew has deep roots in the cannabis industry from multiple perspectives, from the hills of Applegate Valley in Southern Oregon to the indoor basement and commercial warehouse facilities in PDX. We have dedicated teams for operations, equipment and maintenance tasks. Each member brings a unique value to our business and challenge us every day to perfect our craft.




Engrained in the DNA of LOWD™ is the need to help create a better cannabis industry. Our founders and our team believe that in order for the cannabis industry to reach its full potential, it must be a beacon of light for the ability to create a better industry.




Through meaningful efforts to repair harms done by the War on Drugs, our industry can bring people together across the world, despite their differences. Cannabis prohibition enforcement was a driving force in the Mass Incarceration epidemic and we must uplift those who sacrificed their freedom and lives during cannabis prohibition.




We are proud of our support of the NuLeaf Project in Portland, Oregon. This organization is working to grow our market by increasing inclusion and community restoration.

We also support Resource Innovation Institute, who is working to make the indoor agriculture industry more sustainable and efficient, especially in areas of cannabis cultivation.

History
 
“Two Js are better than one.”
 
Luxe Extracts was established by a team of passionate cannabis enthusiasts with decades of experience in marijuana cultivation and treatments. Long before Luxe, the brand’s founder JJ was cultivating cannabis and spent his time discovering the healing properties the plant holds within. He worked with physicians who were integrating medical cannabis into their patient’s treatments and spent his time consulting people battling debilitating ailments such as cancer. Although little in monetary value JJ continued providing his knowledge in the therapeutic properties of marijuana, recommending what strains and types of consumption would best meet their individual needs.
 
 
 
Time turns tides.
 
Throughout the years JJ watched many cannabusinesses come and go. He watched marijuana trends emerge and fade, and he began to hone in on what he wanted to provide the cannabis community. First and foremost was consistency -- JJ wanted to create a brand on which people could rely and supply products that were transparent and innovative. He had studied the science of cannabis for decades, and terpenes in particular for more than two years. It was time to forge a brand that redefines what the cannabis community comes to expect from extractions. JJ and a team of other cannabis enthusiasts with several years of experience came together to create Luxe Extracts.
 
 
 
Preparation took time, and the Luxe team did not want to rush any part of their process. They waited until every part of their concentrates and brand experience were refined into consistent perfection, and on 2015 launched Luxe Extracts. Today, their dedicated team proudly presents their line of cannabis extractions and invite you to live life Luxe.
 
 
 
Process
 
Luxe Extracts believes in refinement and employs it in every part of their process. From the cannabis gardens from which they source their flower to their ever-evolving production facility, Luxe Extracts supplies the best of what the cannabis industry has to offer. Their Butane Hash Oil extraction machine utilizes a closed loop system to yield potent Shatter with incredible clarity. Their extraction artists craft Live Resin Sauces that capture the original flavor and effects of the cultivar at their most amplified.

To experience flowers, edibles, and concentrates at their maximum potential, look to MacKBUD. The MacKBUD difference lies in the maturity of their flowers. MacKBud’s experienced master growers raise their plants in the ideal environment, then give ample time for the plants to ripen and intensify the strain’s characteristics.
 
 
 
History
 
 
 
MacKBUD lacks nothing. Least of which, experience.
 
 
 
This family operated cannabusiness is headed by a grower with years of cannabis cultivation, planting his first buds at the ripe age of 14. He has always viewed as a medicine — the herb garnered his attention as a means to help loved ones battling severe illnesses. But in 2013 he saw an opportunity to take a skill he developed as an enthusiast to the next level.
 
 
 
“You don’t realize what you don’t know until someone teaches you.”
 
 
 
He connected with another grower that bestowed immense cultivation knowledge. The founder’s skills heightened, and he was ready to provide his work to the Michigan cannabis community. MacKBUD launched in 2017, and has proudly served medical cannabis patients in Detroit and beyond.
 
 
 
Process
 
 
 
Quality begins in the garden, and the MacKBUD team knows this full well.
 
 
 
MacKBUD’s master growers tend to every aspect of the plant. With careful attention to detail, the team creates the ideal environment providing the right inputs and nutrients to render clean and healthy plants. The MacKBUD team believes cannabis should be a robust experience and they allow the plants to reach the highest potential before harvest and curing.
 
 
 
Some of those premium flowers are fractionated out to craft MacKBUD’s premium edibles and concentrates. Their extraction artists derive the cannabinoids and terpenes from the plant resulting in concentrates with incredible clarity and potency.
 
 
 
Products
 
MacKBUD’s Cherry White Walker flowers is a dreamy cultivar — dreamy in that toking on these buds will put you to sleep. Cherry White Walker is a heavy Indica with a sweet flavor profile and soothing effects. Just a few hits and the radiating body high sets in, leaving users in utter euphoria.

History
 
Made From Dirt was established by husband and wife cannabis enthusiasts with a dedication to organic products. They entered the cannabis industry in 2007, working at a medical marijuana dispensary in Santa Ana. They shop-hopped as dispensaries closed and opened throughout southern California.
 
 
 
New life, new leaf.
 
When the couple found they were expecting, their outlook on products shifted. The pair grew concerned with the amount of chemicals found in everyday products, especially skincare. The wife began to create her own cosmetics, and the two of them dove into researching the benefits of CBD with a mission: create affordable, non-intoxicating, CBD-infused topicals that can reach those in the cannabis community and beyond. The result was Made From Dirt, and the two were overjoyed to launch their cannabis brand in 2017.
 
 
 
Process
 
Aromatherapy meets cannabis therapy
 
Made From Dirt sources premium-quality, kosher hemp, organically cultivated in Colorado. Those hemp flowers are then extracted into an isolated oil with active CBD and blended into skincare products. Made From Dirt only uses natural ingredients to craft balms and salves. No artificial coloring, or parabens enter Made From Dirt products, and all product fragrances are derived from high-quality essential oils.

2212,"When you want that magical feeling that only cannabis can provide, Magic Pipe is there to grant your wish. Unique, stylish, and reliable concentrate cartridges and disposable vape pens provide easy, flavorful, and discrete relief whenever and wherever you need.
 
History:
 
Magic Pipe stems from the founding and relationship of professionals with a passion. As the marijuana industry began to grow and mature, they knew they could offer a sleek, well-crafted cannabis cartridge that all forward-thinking consumers would love. After extensive months of research and development, they created an easy, effective, and reliable cartridge that equal parts flavor, potency, and consistency.
 
Magic Pipe just had to convince the rest of the world of the superiority of their product. Dispensaries are known for their rigorous and extremely selective view of accepting new products. Without the big brand name, Magic Pipe had to live or die solely on the quality of the products. Beginning in early 2017, they started dropping off samples to any dispensary that would give them a shot. Only three months later and Magic Pipe cartridges and vape pens can be found in over 30 dispensaries throughout Southern California.
 
As Magic Pipe grows, their missions grows, too. They hope to reach more dispensaries throughout Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Bay Area, reaching as many people as they can.
 
Products:
 
Magic Pipe cartridges and disposable vape pens are filled with cannabis distillate that is strain specific, making it incredibly flavorful and potent. Utilizing a molecular distillation technique, then reintroducing strain specific terpenes that make for a flavor profile that is true to the original cannabis flower, Magic Pipe distillate is perfect for cannabis connoisseurs and newcomers alike. Cartridges are extremely reliable with a practically nonexistent fail rate, and their disposable vape pens average 280 hits.
 
Lab Testing:
 
At Magic Pipe, they know the importance proving transparency to their customers and building trust with the cannabis community. That’s why they do rigorous testing with SC Labs, one of the leading cannabis analytical laboratories in all of California. They test their concentrate cartridges and vape pens for cannabinoid profiles (potency), pesticides, and microbial screening.
 
Networks:
 
Magic Pipe is proud of their growing network of cannabis enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, and hope to meet more people within the cannabis community. Their products can be found in High Spot in Inglewood, CT Compassion Caregivers in Silverlake, HHC+ in Downtown Los Angeles, and other dispensaries and deliveries all over Los Angeles and Southern California.",,842,8e/8e6368d1936c5dc20d0f0aaeb15aab3b8466e168.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/212/avatar/original/1615401634-Magic_Pipe_web-01.png,,Magic Pipe,4.49315071105957,90,magic-pipe,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/magic-pipe,,,,,,,,,,,,

Este es el caso de nuestro amigo y colaborador Stitch, desarrollador y colaborador en la creación de las variedades automáticas y creador de las nuevas variedades Súper Autos (Stitch es un reconocido experto en la creación de variedades de automáticas y nos ofrece sus mejores selecciones originales), también contamos con el genial y reconocido diseñador Rosenfeld, con este equipo nace este banco, que pretende proveer de genéticas estables y originales a un mercado saturado aunque al mismo tiempo vacío. El logo de Makka Seeds ha sido desarrollado a partir de la idea de incluir en una imagen lo que nuestra planta madre simboliza: sus conexiones neuronales con nuestro sistema nervioso, la metáfora de la germinación de la semilla como si de la fertilidad se tratase, nuestro Dios interior ubicado en la boca del estómago y representado por el giro constante del universo o infinito o nuestra sonrisa interior. La misión de Makka Seeds es, por tanto, ofrecer las mejores, estables y más selectas cepas del mercado. Nos sentimos orgullosos de lo que llegamos a ofrecer. Genéticas muy consolidadas, con miras a grandes premios, 100% garantía de germinación, plantas que no decepcionarán al sibarita más selecto. Bienvenidos y bienvenidas. SEMILLAS FEMINIZADAS Unos progenitores fuertes y sanos y el cuidado apropiado proporcionan semillas fuertes que germinan con vigor. Las semillas fuertes producen plantas sanas y cosechas abundantes. Hoy en día, en el cultivo del cannabis nos encontramos con la capacidad de ofrecer a nuestros clientes semillas cien por cien feminizadas, las semillas hembra se producen obteniendo polen de un individuo hembra y, subsiguientemente, fertilizando otra planta hembra, es decir, los esquemas de reproducción hembra=hembra solo producen descendencia femenina, o lo que es lo mismo sus semillas solo contendrán los cromosomas XX, dando lugar por tanto a solo plantas femeninas. Makka Seeds ofrece la mejor crianza cannábica en semillas feminizadas fruto de la mejor selección genética. SEMILLAS AUTOFLORECIENTES Las plantas autoflorecientes son aquellas que no dependen del ciclo de luz – oscuridad para comenzar la fase de floración. Por lo tanto, son ideales para plantarlas en invierno y tener una cosecha que nos proporcione un poco de marihuana hasta que hagamos el cultivo serio para recogerlo en otoño. Estas plantas de marihuana no son tan grandes como las variedades de floración por ciclo de luz, así que quizás necesitemos más ejemplares para autoabastecernos. Estas plantas son resultados de diversos cruces entre variedades índica, sativa y rudelaris. Las de la variedad rudelaris son las auténticas plantas autoflorecientes, y los cruces se utilizan para obtener plantas con más cantidad y mayores cogollos y una resina más potente que las rudelaris puras. Se suelen utilizar variedades tropicales en los cruces para obtener sabores más afrutados y agradables, y mayor cantidad de THC. En unos 75 días tras su germinación se pueden obtener buenas cosechas para las características de este tipo de plantas. Su tamaño varía entre 30 y 50 centímetros, pero su producción es alta, pudiendo obtener ejemplares que son prácticamente un cogollo continuo. Podemos utilizar el armario de las madres para su cultivo o podemos cultivarlas en exterior si las temperaturas no son excesivamente bajas. Aunque su espectacular resistencia dada su procedencia (del norte de Asia) las hace aguantar climas fríos si la temperatura no baja por la noche del punto de congelación.",,37,28/281c22ec4aff294c699171c45f73c9290d1c5c8f.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/928/avatar/original/Makka-Seeds_logo.jpg,,Makka Seeds,5,0,makka-seeds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/makka-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,

After decades of collective unconsciousness and stigmatization, science has silenced myths and lies about the cannabis plant unveiling its awesome potential for human development (therapeutic effects of cannabis are scientifically widely proven), social growth (to consume a plant cannot be accepted a crime), environmental health (agriculture, construction and plastic businesses can be reconverted into greener industries).
 
For this reason, we want to actively contribute to the rehabilitation of the cannabis industry and take part to a cultural shift towards a more ethical, sustainable and conscious future.
 
We create products from certified cannabis (hemp) genetics cultivated organically with natural fertilizers and without the use of herbicides or pesticides to maintain intact the phytocannabinoids of the plant.

You may need to brush up on your Dutch for this one! Manx Farms strives to make a lifestyle out of their motto; “Hou het schoon,” which means “keep it clean.” Manx Farms offers immaculate cannabis flowers and edibles from a selection of exotic and landrace strains. Keeping it clean is their philosophy, and Manx Farms works diligently to utilize best practices in every area of their cannabusiness. Their menu features organic marijuana master grown in small, quality controlled environments.
 
 
 
History
 
Manx Farms brought together the collective effort of renowned master growers and cannabis cultivation to source their menu of marijuana products. The founder of Manx Farms visited more than 700 grow facilities and picked 11 of the best to contribute to their menu. The cannabis community is their livelihood, and Manx Farms was certain to only work with collectives that share their level of passion for marijuana. Through collaboration and sharing strains, Manx Farms was able to improve their products standards and provide fuller, more accurate information to the consumer.
 
 
 
Process
 
True dedication to doing it right is a daring endeavor. Manx Farms is pleased to be part of a network of marijuana enthusiasts who’ve taken risks and put in years of work to provide premium cannabis. These expert cultivators have embarked on real genetic hunts, traveling to countries like Colombia and Nepal to obtain landrace strains from their natural environment.
 
 
 
Doing it right is never easy, but providing medical cannabis with complete genetics information allows patients to see the whole picture about what they’re putting in their body. Manx Farms is proud to stay ahead of compliance, providing medical cannabis that surpasses the upcoming regulatory standards.
 
 
 
Products
 
Manx Farms flowers epitomize purity and authenticity. With a menu comprised of medical marijuana strains that are lab tested per batch and cultivated from seeds with secure genetics. Cultivation practices and seed sourcing are not the only ways Manx Farms “does it right,” their other cannabis products exude perfection as well. You won’t find any trim in Manx Farm prerolls. Manx Farms uses only nugs of flower to fill their premium joints and provides a glass clutch in each. Manx Farms offers edibles for the non-smoking cannabis community. Patients are especially fond of their made-from-scratch medicated gummies. As far as flowers are concerned, Manx Farms has noticed patients gravitating toward their Durban Poison strain. This Sativa strain packs more than 20% THC in its densely resinous leaves.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
Manx Farms follows the t ""Keep it Clean"" motto through full-spectrum lab tests provided by Santa Cruz Labs. Honesty and transparency are of the utmost importance to Manx Farms, and lab results are published on their site for each of their medical cannabis products.",,62,6a/6a16afb1d006430614d21250beed2559b6f0a295.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/605/avatar/original/Manx_logo200x200.jpg,,Manx Farms,5,8,manx-farms,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/manx-farms,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The right plants for the right place.”
 
Marks Organix proudly supplies organic, connoisseur quality flowers and edibles to Maine cannabis patients. This cannabusiness stands as a holistic solution to pain management, sleep aid, addiction control, and the full gamut of what cannabis can provide. Marks Organix’ founder and master grower is dedicated to delivering the best quality cannabis, not produce the highest yields. When you enjoy a bowl of Marks Organix flowers or edibles, you are experiencing cannabis as it should be -- soil grown and solvent free. Find your holistic solution, with Marks Organix Maine patients receive the right plants for the place.
 
 
 
History
 
Mark’s relationship with plants has always been a close one, his knack for cultivating and curating beautiful gardens and landscapes evident from a young age. His green thumb was put to use early in his life, which eventually led to his first entrepreneurial pursuit: Marks Organic Landscaping, a Maine landscaping service.
 
 
 
All the while Mark wanted to cultivate for a cause, as many in Maine lost their quality of their life to pharmaceutical medications. He embarked in cannabis cultivation and utilized his years of experience to grow cannabis flowers. Although his long history of gardening experience helped, he still had much to learn and overcome when farming cannabis.
 
Eventually, Mark fine-tuned his approach and learned how to yield potent, chemical-free cannabis, cultivated with sustainable methods. He expanded his capabilities with cannabis extraction by adding distillate to his skill set and crafting infused edibles for a smoke-free medical cannabis option. Today, Mark is overjoyed to serve the Maine medical cannabis community through Marks Organix, delivering safe, effective, and holistic treatments.
 
 
 
Process
 
Mark will tell ya --it’s 110% organic.
 
Mark has an affinity for doing things the right way and sees that commitment through in every aspect of his cannabusiness. From soil to oil, or flowers alike, Marks Organix delivers one hundred (and ten!)(and ! percent organic cannabis products. He sources his seeds from local breeders and seed banks with stable genetics. Mark then sews them into nutrient-rich soil with an ecosystem entirely of its own. Marks Organix soil maintains a healthy relationship between fungi and bacteria, and these microorganisms break down nutrients allowing it to feed his flowers with abundance. No pesticides here! Mark instead employs a natural solution by planting his plants alongside one another for biological pest control.
 
Uncut concentrate
 
Marks Organix’ edibles are infused with active cannabis distillate that makes for evenly dosed edibles.Thanks to his unwavering commitment to organic solutions, Marks Organix utilizes solventless extraction to craft their distillate oil. That uncut concentrate is then blended into this line of edibles and topicals to deliver potent, all-natural relief. 


 
Lab Testing
 
Marks Organix is pleased to offer Maine lab-tested medical cannabis products provided by ProVerde Laboratories. Their cannabis products undergo testing for present cannabinoids and their percentages, terpene profiles, salmonella, mold, and mildew. Marks Organix is committed to the safety of their products and strives to deliver the best quality cannabis to Maine patients.",,1327,dd/ddd04d57e0364fe014473bc17089d1e93b963e1f.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/295/avatar/original/1562108415-fullsizeoutput_b1.jpeg,,Marks Organix,4.8505744934082,29,mark-s-organix,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/mark-s-organix,,,,,,,,,,,,

2025,"One planet, many plants

 

You are here because you chose a different path for your happiness and health. We support your personal journey by offering this amazing plant embraced over thousands of years in a variety of ways. Medical, Spiritual or Therapeutic it offers so much and asks for so little in return.

History:

marQaha was founded in 2010 and remains one of the most trusted cannabis companies in the industry. Before there was a global preference for how cannabis was presented as medicine, the founders behind marQaha recognized the plant’s medicinal potential, for its been used spiritually and recreationally for thousands of years. We decided to name our company “marQaha,” an ancient Arabic word that refers to the feeling of “bliss” while drinking coffee and has come to mean “someone or something impossible to hate.”

Over the years, marQaha has heard hundreds of incredible stories and met amazing patients all over the country. As we continue to learn about the potential and power of the cannabis plant, we look forward to continuing on the journey with everyone in the cannabis community.

Process:

marQaha approaches our products with the saying “a chain is only as strong as its weakest link” and bring this wisdom to every day’s production. We have a delicate balance of hands-on production with small batch perfection by bringing unique ingredients such as coffee beans, chamomile tea, and blueberries together in harmony within the product blend. We source locally and globally, using only the finest ingredients and foster relationships with farmers, roasters, and suppliers to make the most trusted and high level cannabis good product possible. It isn’t the fast way, it’s the right way. It’s through slow but deliberate perfection that we are able to bring the harmonious power of cannabis into each marQaha product.




So what does this word mean you ask? 

 

 

 

marQaha is an old Arabic word that has come to mean ""enlightened bliss"" that originated from the drinking of ""qahwa"" that was brewed from the coffee ""bunn"" (bean) and used in a variety of ways to stimulate the mind and body. As early as 1221, the dancing, free-thinking Sufi sect combined coffee and cannabis as Bhang or as a green tincture sipped from a vessel (""the Emerald Cup"") to establish a deeper connection with their creator.

 

We felt the combination of spirituality and a deep historical connection to the plant should be continued into the future as people find and embrace their own path to bliss and truth.",marqaha,837,b9/b9582312d7bc381821eed627cbe595c7483e3bc9.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/025/avatar/original/marqaha_logo.jpg,marqaha_,MarQaha,4.58333349227905,2,marqaha,marqaha,https://weedmaps.com/brands/marqaha,www.marqaha.com,,,,,,,,,,,

1503,"Mary Jane’s Medicinals was founded by Dahlia Mertens in 2010. After being introduced to a cannabis infused massage oil in the beautiful mountains of Northern California, she was inspired to return to her home state of Colorado and start a line of cannabis infused topical body products. The Medical Marijuana movement in Colorado was just starting to gain momentum so it was a good time to start an MMJ business- some people refer to that time as the gold rush for cannabis in Colorado. It was a bit like the wild west, until the state regulations were brought into effect. Dahlia has a background as a massage therapist, and started using the oil on some of her clients. She was amazed at the feedback she was hearing, and blown away by the large variety of ailments her products were helping to relieve and even heal. When people think about cannabis as a healing herb they seldom think about the topical application- they typically think about smoking it or eating it. So, on her sales calls to MMJ centers in the early days she had to really educate the people around her that the topical application of cannabis was a very powerful and effective way of experiencing the healing properties of this amazing plant. Also, for people who do not wish to experience the psychoactive properties of ingesting cannabis, a topical alternative is ideal, because you still get the healing and pain relieving properties without feeling mentally altered.
 
During Dahlias’ visit to Northern California in 2009 she had the opportunity of walking through an outdoor garden of medical cannabis plants. It was dusk and the sky was filled with the warm colors of sunset. The “girls”, as cannabis plants are often affectionately referred to, were 12’ tall and even larger in diameter. Their branches were heavily laden with plump and glistening buds, covered in the healing resins of cannabis, reflecting all the magical colors of that sunset. The beauty of that moment was powerful, and she was filled with a reverence for these plants, that they truly were very special. As this thought popped into her head; a light breeze picked up and a five fingered fan leaf the size of her face gently caressed her cheek, sending chills through her body. It was as if the plant was confirming this thought. This thought has been confirmed every day since we began making these products at Mary Jane’s Medicinals, and we have found it so rewarding to give people a natural and effective way of treating and healing a very wide variety of ailments. In our opinion cannabis truly is a gift and quite possibly the most medicinal plant on our planet.",,1123,7d/7dc4d280d606ca3a2650a20f4894947af0c98eeb.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/503/avatar/original/1524514620-Mary-Jane_s-Medicinals_Logo.jpg,,Mary Jane's Medicinals,4.63636350631714,4,mary-jane-s-medicinals,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/mary-jane-s-medicinals,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maui Grown Therapies heralds a new era of medical marijuana therapies in Hawaii, proud to open their dispensary doors and aid patients in need. Their medical marijuana dispensary cultivates the highest quality plants and offers registered medical marijuana patients the compassionate care and treatments they need to improve their quality of life.
 
History:
 
Maui Grown Therapies stands as the first medical marijuana dispensary in Hawaii, finally opened nearly 17 years after the state’s legalization of marijuana for medical use. They fought tooth and nail to earn Hawaii’s first cannabis dispensary license in early 2016, receiving a nearly perfect score on the state’s merit-based evaluation procedure. The Hawaii Department of Health granted Maui Grown Therapies permission to cultivate their first flowers in February 2017, and on August 8, 2017, they opened their facility’s Kahului doors for the first time. Physician-led and patient-centered, Maui Grown Therapies is humbled to play this important role in introducing their Maui marijuana dispensary and treatments to patients in Kahului and beyond.
 
Staff:
 
The team at Maui Grown Therapies offers high-class compassion and individualized care to every one of their patients. Their Advisory Board, led by a team of physicians, agriculturalists, and researchers, often meets to bring the latest cannabis research and advances to their Maui marijuana dispensary. Maui Grown Therapies serves as a resource for their patients, taking the time to walk them through their marijuana products to help them understand how cannabis can fit specific health concerns. Maui Grown’s Kahului Patient Education Specialists received training from Michael Backes, cannabis author and researcher, and look forward to passing on their knowledge.
 
Menu:
 
Maui Grown Therapies utilizes solar-power, recaptured irrigation water, and other green processes to keep their marijuana cultivation facility sustainable and to grow the best cannabis plants. Their Maui dispensary will provide a menu of dried marijuana flower, cannabis infused oils and lotions, distilled tinctures and concentrated marijuana. When Hawaii opens its first certified laboratory, all of Maui Grown Therapies’ Kahului-raised cannabis will undergo lab testing for quality assurance. Starting August 14, registered medical marijuana patients may walk in anytime to meet with Maui Grown Therapies’ patient education specialists at no charge. Their dispensary encourages those with questions to reach out via email, phone call or Facebook with any questions. Their Kahului facility provides plenty of parking.
 
Service Locations:
 
Maui Grown Therapies stands in the Maui Lani Village Center in Kahului, Hawaii. Their facility welcomes patients from Wailuku, Waikapu, Ah Fong Village, and Kahului central. Patients are invited from Spreckelsville, Pukalani, Makawao, and Maalaea to explore their medical marijuana therapies.

10927,"LET’S TALK STORY

In late September, 1996, a group of kānaka maoli and kamaʻāina (native & local Hawaiians) met a haole (foreigner, or in this case, a white guy!) at the basketball courts at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. They quickly built a bond and brotherhood and welcomed this haole into their ʻohana (family). Twenty three years later, that bond strengthened as they created Mauka Makai Farms, a line of premium cannabis products. Mauka Makai Farms, which translates to “from the mountain to the ocean”, is the perfect description of where our true Aloha Spirit (along with great cannabis) and ʻohana reside.

Additionally, a portion of our profits will be donated back to various charities designed to help preserve the Hawaiian culture.

So whether you are Hawaiian, Hawaiian at heart or just a cannabis user, we invite you to sit back, relax and enjoy our premium quality products at Mauka Makai Farms. ~ Mahalo",,64,6a/6aab0618f8958e65a282b6d8d39e1712f5fb7f0c.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/010/927/avatar/original/1600196169-Logo_JPG.jpg,,Mauka Makai Farms,4,0,mauka-makai-farms,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/mauka-makai-farms,,,,,,,,,,,,

MedCare Farms provides premium cannabis flowers cultivated with a combination of passion and meticulous craftsmanship formed by years of experience. Our flowers provide a consistent experience upon which all patients can rely. With MedCare Farms quality comes first, and our founders strive to provide boutique quality cannabis that boasts quality, not quantity. For high-end, craft cannabis flowers, MedCare Farms is your ticket to euphoria.




HISTORY

MedCare Farms was established in 2009 by a husband and wife duo who have experienced the life-enhancing effects of medical cannabis firsthand. As a Veteran, wife and co-founder of MedCare Farms, found healing in medical cannabis. But in 2008, her husband, got into a motorcycle accident that left him in need of pain management medication. During his treatment, he noticed the prescribed pharmaceuticals depleted the quality of his life and slowly changed who he was. He turned to medical cannabis as an alternative and immediately found the relief he was searching for without the cost of his happiness and personality. The two decided to focus their efforts on making cannabis available to as many in need as possible. They have a personal affinity for all of the cannabis community. 




PROCESS

Every strain on the MedCare Farms menu has been vetted through multiple runs, fine-tuning the phenotype of the plant to provide the best version of each cultivar. We never stop evolving; as our team sees it, when the patient’s needs change, so should we. MedCare Farms strives to remain in step with the voice of the cannabis community.




Cultivated with Passion

Every bud is blanketed in resinous trichomes, but what you can’t see is the plant dripping with the love and devotion from MedCare Farms’ Master Growers. Passion goes into everything we cultivate, which is why we refuse to cut corners and make every effort for supreme quality. Our flowers are grown indoors in a clean facility without the use of any pesticides for maximum quality control. The MedCare Farms team cares for the cannabis with their own hands, hand-trimming each plant during harvest. We employ a slow dry-curing process, where our buds sit for a minimum of 28 days. From start to finish, each step of the cultivation process is carried out meticulously. When you toke on flowers from MedCare Farms you are smoking cannabis done right.




PRODUCTS

To single out just one strain as a signature of MedCare Farms is an exercise in futility. We serve every niche and need of the cannabis community leaving each patient with their very own personal favorite or “signature strain.”

3734,"In 2014, the founders of MM Genetics witnessed the therapeutic nature of cannabis while treating a founder’s mother. Candida Green was battling late-stage pancreatic cancer. Hours after her first dose of cannabis oil her pain was significantly reduced and in the following weeks, her quality of life dramatically improved.
 
The website medicalmarijuana.co.uk was set up shortly after her death with the simple aim of raising awareness of the real medicinal properties of the Cannabis Sativa L plant.
 
The benefits of the cannabis oil were clearly visible to those around her and awoke a passion and deep interest in the use of cannabis as a medicine. A concept to source and sell seeds with exciting therapeutic benefits was developed while raising awareness in local communities.
 
Through the organisation’s interaction with patients and cannabis communities worldwide, it quickly became apparent that the need was for cannabis genetics that targeted specific symptoms.
 
Medical Marijuana Genetics was formed in 2015 and began working with award-winning breeders and caregivers. A line of CBD dominant cannabis strains has since been created and has gone on to win several awards including best CBD strain at Spannabis 2017. These CBD cannabis seeds are now available here.
 
The laboratory tests of our flagship strain, Candida, revealed a CBD count of 20% with a THC count of under 1%. This percentage is the highest known count in a CBD-rich phenotype ever created in Europe.
 
Following the overwhelming success of their first grow, Medical Marijuana Genetics created a further 12 elite strains from Candida crosses, all of which have been genetically selected to provide access (within the lawful jurisdiction) to the broadest range of therapeutics that the cannabis plant, and CBD in particular, has to offer. This includes treatments for symptoms such chronic pain, inflammation, seizures, convulsions, gastrointestinal disorders, nausea, vomiting, skin conditions, bacterial infections, anxiety, depression, cancer cell growth and much more.",medicalmarijuanagenetics,138,cf/cf5babd66d0a77ecb94d8ed3996b43da2df05df9.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/734/avatar/original/1512132396-logo.jpg,,Medical Marijuana Genetics,5,0,medical-marijuana-genetics,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/medical-marijuana-genetics,https://mmgenetics.eu,,,,,,,,,,,

Meeting MaryJane is a Washington D.C. based producer of premium cannabis flowers and edibles. Meeting MaryJane’s mission is to connect the cannabis community in the District of Columbia to marijuana products of the highest quality. Not only does the Meeting MaryJane team focus on quality products, but they also foster a dedication to quality information. With their commitment to quality information and products, Meeting MaryJane enhances the quality of life for Washington D.C.’s 420-friendly — one silver-lined puff at a time.
 
 
 
History
 
With a decade of experience in cannabis cultivation, Taxx and Wes bring the best of the best to the District of Columbia. Their introduction to growing marijuana happened the same way so many other legends have — in a backyard garden. The two weaved in and out of the cannabis industry, awaiting a more stable political climate to apply their skills. Even while absent on the production side, Taxx and Wes remained connected to the cannabis community.
 
 
 
Cannabis-friendly events began to pop-up in Washington D.C. and they were all too happy to attend the weed parties where they could stir up interest and talk to marijuana vendors.
 
They noticed a gap — patients didn’t get accurate strain information at shops, making finding the right flowers and products difficult. Taxx and Wes set out to change that by developing a brand that valued quality products as much as education and had a goal of supporting everyone whether they were acquainted with cannabis or not. The result was Meeting MaryJane, a brand that Taxx and Wes proudly launched in December 2017.
 
 
 
Process
 
All Meeting MaryJane products are crafted with the utmost care for quality control. Flowers are first cultivated in an indoor cannabis farm, giving growers full reign over every input of during the grow. The grow room is pumped with CO2, giving the plants ample nourishment to produce large, resinous buds. This yields flowers with remarkable bud appeal — every Meeting MaryJane bud possesses a distinct aroma and flavor.
 
 
 
As for Meeting MaryJane’s edibles, the same level of meticulous craftsmanship goes into those, as well. Flowers are decarboxylated into Coconut Oil for vegan-friendly edibles and clarified butter

History
 
Monique, the founder of Mellow Desserts LLC, was inspired to start a cannabusiness when she learned the incredible benefits the plant could offer. As a cannabis enthusiasts herself, Monique quickly noticed edibles did not taste so pleasant. She dove into cannabis research, seeking out the best ways to create great-tasting edibles that still delivered in effectiveness. With taste as a priority, she developed a line of cannabis-infused baked goods that are as tasty as they are potent. Monique was proud to launch her LLC and debuted her cannabis creations to the California cannabis community in August 2017. She has no interest in becoming the next edible giant. Instead, she focuses her efforts on what she can bring to the cannabis community, both to businesses and consumers.
 
 
 
Process
 
Mellow Desserts LLC sources its cannabis from an in-house garden, ensuring maximum quality control. Once the premium flowers have been harvested, decarboxylation begins. Monique infuses active cannabinoids into butter and olive oil, resulting in effective ingredients that mask any weed-y, plant-like taste. Then, those ingredients come together in delectable pastries and baked goods made by hand.

1679,"Michigan Organic Rub creates essential cannabis-infused healing lotions and balms out of dedication to suffering patients. Continually refining their processes and working with top-quality materials, Michigan Organic Rub's topicals offer immediate, soothing and lasting relief.
 
History:
 
Michigan Organic Rub was created out of necessity, designed to offer optimal healing and pain relief benefits to patients in need. The founder of Michigan Organic Rub was involved in a rollover car accident in early 2012, and after being bedridden for months and suffering from painkillers’ and prescription medicine’s side effects, he decided to pursue homeopathic methods. Following thorough research, he created a formula combining cannabis with essential plant products to use himself, and when he began sharing it with his friends and family more people began requesting it for their own pain relief. Thus, Michigan Organic Rub was born in 2013, offering a flushed-out line of cannabis-infused topicals to aid patients in need of natural and lasting relief.
 
Process:
 
Michigan Organic Rub goes the extra mile to ensure their topicals are effective, potent and pure of any unnecessary or unwanted materials. They take extra steps with their extract partners’ cannabis oils, winterizing the materials to remove excess plant fats and retain pure cannabinoids. Using magnetic stirring methods, Michigan Organic Rub then combines the cannabis oil with beeswax, organic olive oils, emu oil, house-made magnesium oil and much more, as well as their unique essential oil, blended scents created in-house.
 
Products:
 
At the end of their formulation process, Michigan Organic Rub proudly offers a range of aromatic, highly efficient cannabis-infused lotions and balms that ease pain within minutes of application. Patients love their Vanilla Mint Extra Releaf, containing a full 1g of cannabis oil compared to their regular sized 0.5g lotions. Michigan Organic Rub also offers scents like Cider Donuts, Orange Creme, and Organic Lemon.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Michigan Organic Rub collaborates with PSI Labs in Ann Arbor to test their marijuana products for potency, residual solvents, and any other contaminants to ensure they offer the best possible lotions to their patients.
 
Networks:
 
Michigan Organic Rub partners with Golden Glove Extracts and Tree-Top Wellness Group in Michigan to formulate their pain-relief cannabis products. Patients can find their topicals in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Lansing, and Flint, in many dispensaries including The Patient Station, 315 North, Unified Collective and House of Dank.",,1155,e7/e72399450f9cd1276e5f6323133c3e824d36e1e3.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/679/avatar/original/michigan-organic-rub_logo.jpg,,Michigan Organic Rub,4.84114599227905,19,michigan-organic-rub,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/michigan-organic-rub,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flavorful, potent and fresh, Kali Extracts partners with expert growers and utilizes the latest in industry methods to take their products to the next level. Their mission? Enjoyable and safe consumption of cannabis for the California patient community.
 
 
 
History:
 
Kali Extracts got its start in 2016, formed by a group of marijuana enthusiasts dedicated to advancing safety and quality in the industry. Based in Northern California, their team began utilizing CO2 extraction methods along with the latest in marijuana technologies to create stable, pure, and flavorful cannabis oil. Kali Extracts is dedicated to offering healthy life choices through their cannabis consumption options and has created a fantastic product to enhance their patients’ quality of life.
 
 
 
Process:
 
To fill their vape cartridges, Kali Extracts uses supercritical CO2 extraction technologies - one of the industry’s most effective methods of creating concentrates. The CO2-extracted oil retains their source plants’ terpene profiles, offering a flavorful final product that provides the added benefits of the entourage effect. In the end, Kali Extracts uses a low-temperature triple distillation process that gives their cannabis oil the pure, golden color for which it's known. Kali Extracts promises a robust and clean vaping experience with every puff. All Kali Extracts cartridges are free of solvents and test between 69-83% THC.
 
 
 
Products:
 
Kali Extracts’ strain-specific vape cartridges cater to the connoisseurs of the marijuana community, distilling the community’s favorite genetics into oil form. They never use artificial flavoring or additives; they instead reintroduce the strain's natural terpenes into their oil after extraction. Strains like Thin Mints, Skywalker, and Pineapple Express fill their cartridges, and their CBD options are perfect for vape users who prefer a non-psychoactive experience. Every 1-gram cartridge lasts between 300 and 400 inhales. Kali Extracts also offers a selection of vape batteries to complement their marijuana products.

Named “Best Edible” at the 2015 Colorado High Times Cannabis Cup – Keef Cola is made with the highest quality CO2 cannabis extract oil and pure cane sugar. Available in 10mg and 100mg Medical.




Back in 2010, Boulder, Colorado-based Erik Knutson, with the help of family and friends, set his sights on creating a new way to experience the simple pleasure of enjoying a drink with friends: drinkable cannabis.

Inspired by the notion of combining the fun, social, celebratory experience of drinking with the magic and joy of cannabis, Erik mixed up an early batch of “Keef Cola” and placed a prototype in front of his beloved Grandma Dee. (Because if an 85-year-old woman who’s never smoked cannabis in her life loves it, then they might just be onto something.) Dee opened the bottle and took a sip. And then another. That day, Keef was born.




A decade later, Keef has grown from a small Colorado cannabis-infused beverage company to a much-awarded brand - developing, manufacturing, and distributing cannabis and CBD-infused products across seven US states. Keef products include multiple lines of popular beverage options, as well CO2-extracted oil for vape cartridges.

 History
 Khush Kush was founded on a foundation of happiness - it’s in the name!
 
 “Khush” spelled with an “h” means happy in Hindi, so pairing “happy” with marijuana seemed like the perfect name for this premium cannabis collective. Eager to learn from the mistakes of trial and error within this new and blossoming industry, Khush Kush began their brand on the right note. 
 
 Khush Kush was excited to receive their license to be in their new building on April of 2016. Building their grow from the ground up gave Khush Kush the opportunity to design one of the most efficient indoor marijuana grows. Doing everything from seed is not without challenges, but Khush Kush was glad to embark on the task of pheno-hunting. After securing a high-end seed library, the next hurdle for Kush Kush was the unfamiliarity in the cannabis market. However, Washington quickly gravitated to Khush Kush’s quality marijuana products. Their devotion to marijuana shows in their flowers and extractions, and in turn the cannabis community showed their enthusiasm. 
 
 Today, Khush Kush happily serves the marijuana community of Washington, welcoming anyone 21 and over to discover their happiness.
 
 Products

Reviewing Khush Kush’s menu is sure to put a smile on your face, with strains such as Wonder Kid, East Coast Sour D, and The White patients have plenty of premium cannabis to enjoy. The cannabis community can’t seem to get enough of their Item 9, Bell-Ringer, Clementine, and Brandywine strains either. But regardless of what strain you go with, Khush Kush is sure to connect the person with their happiness. 
 
 Process
 Khush Kush’s passion for marijuana stems from knowing they are cultivating a plant that cultivates happiness. Their growers and extraction artists derive much joy from their job, and it shows in their marijuana. Kush Kush supplies the purest forms of cannabis, so the marijuana community knows exactly what they are putting into their bodies. Their flowers are cultivated, harvested and cured to perfection, and concentrates processed by the extraction artists of Amberbrick. Their menu is sure to impress any flower child or 710 enthusiast, and it is Khush Kush’s pleasure to bring quality marijuana products to Washington.

WHY SUBLINGUAL?
 
When cannabis is absorbed sublingually, or under the tongue, it simply works better. Traditional edibles, like brownies, gummies, and cookies, are often distorted by stomach acids and then broken down by the liver.
 
Sublingual cannabis products, on the other hand, are pulled straight into the bloodstream through the membranes in the mouth.

11030,"Why Kind?

In our current wellness crisis, people are searching for ways to receive all the benefits of the cannabis plant without any negative physical impact. kind Creations offer healing cannabis in as pure a form possible, with no sugars or added ‘extras’.

Kind’s pure plant products honor traditional methods of processing, combining the cannabis plant with superfoods (organic olive or coconut oils) without blasting or separating the plant from its natural state. A complete transfer of the entire cannabinoid profile is infused into our products in a proprietary, multi-day process that requires the utmost care and attention to detail. This is what sets kind Creations apart and dramatically improves efficacy and ease of consumption, while doing no physical harm. Unlike the industry standard of blasted, molecularly separated bio-mass-derived oils, our single-strain, pure plant creations do not use any cannabis concentrates, distillates, extracts, or isolates. 98% of all other “full spectrum” products use CO2 oil, volatile distillation methods, or alcohol extractions that are then reconstructed with additives to mimic what the plant was like before it was processed. Our capsules and tinctures contain no processed oils. They are M.C.T. free!
Kind Creations have no negative impact on your respiratory system!


Capsules, Tinctures, or Rubs…Which should I use and Why?
One of the main reasons to consider adding our consumables and topicals to your cannabis regime is to protect your respiratory system. Our production methods offer the consumption of pure plant cannabis without the smoke, or any adverse physical effects. Unlike most cannabis edibles that feature sugar as a main ingredient, diabetics and those watching their calories will appreciate knowing that our capsules and tinctures contain no sugars, additives, artificial colors, or preservatives.

Just pure plant cannabis goodness infused into a super food!",,157,26/26849c9236402b2612f6243ea2a84ce46c9cf93c.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/011/030/avatar/original/1605749117-kindcreations_logo_theoriginalcreations__1_.png,,Kind Creations,4.33333349227905,0,kind-creations,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/kind-creations,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cannabis for a KIND new world.

We believe that every strain has its own story, resulting in unique flavors and aromas. That is why we focus our efforts on the art and science of cannabis cultivation, so each plant can reach its full potential.

 

At Kind Tree, we are dedicated to cultivating and producing cannabis with sustainable and eco-friendly techniques, such as; a commitment to clean, healthy soil and the use of organic growing techniques, no chemical pesticides, water reclamation systems to preserve our precious resources, and the use of both natural sunlight and supplemental LED lighting to keep our electricity usage low.

 

Our master grower personally inspects every harvest for plants that exhibit the absolute finest expression of each cultivar, showcasing exceptional plant health, trichome sheen, aroma, color, flavor profile and cannabinoid content.

 

Kind Tree’s Grower’s Reserve is our personal collection of timeless top-shelf strains that are hand-selected to ensure the finest experience. From our stash to yours, these strains feature rare and unique genetic profiles that are difficult to find.

 

We are always on the hunt for rare and special genetics for our regional markets, and with world-famous strains like Cherry Garcia, Zour Apples, Grandpas Stash, Ecto Cooler, Golden Goat, Ice Cream Punch and Purple Majik, our team has the ability to consistently bring new and exciting products to market.

Kinda High is a game changing new cannabis product designed by people who are obsessed with unlocking the limitless potential of cannabis in our day-to-day lives. In our never-ending journey to get the most out of our cannabis, we decided to focus on some key problems we noticed in the space. Mainly, the lack of transparency on what is in products, blends that are too strong to use in everyday situations, and an absence of science at a cannabinoid and terpene level to customize the experience. With all the research being done into cannabinoids and terpenes, we were shocked to find so little of this translated into the products on the market.

We come together to grow, purvey and design the highest quality products possible–all of this supporting the mission to bring people together through cannabis while evolving the image of the cannabis user.







CULTIVATION




Totaling 122 years of industry experience, our staff of 54 employees come from 22 different states/countries and bring a wealth of experience and diverse ideas to the team. Their time is spent at our boutique indoor grow (great for experiments) allows for innovation to flourish. Our cultivation team has attracted top university grads as well as self-taught cannabis enthusiasts. This results in a perfect dichotomy between street smarts and book smarts… and we like it that way.







EXTRACTION




The perfect compliment to our cultivation, our extraction lab is state-of-the-art. Priding ourselves in the use of clean extraction methods (no BHO’s here), our team of qualified scientists push the limit of cannabis infusions. With the newest technologies we’re able to create high-quality, potent, and most importantly consistent dosing to the Kindred Cannabis line of products. No method of delivery is too wild for our extraction team, we can’t wait to see what they come up with next.







BRANDING




Our in-house design team is all about bringing the cannabis experience to life through visual storytelling. The entire Kindred Cannabis brand was conceived by acknowledging that no two cannabis users are the same, and that is to be celebrated. Every Kindred Cannabis asset was created and designed with the patient experience in mind. Developed to encourage the use of cannabis in a responsible manner and to be proud of the relationship this plant creates with one’s own mind, body and spirit.







COMPLETE PLANT NUTRITION




We create, mix and perfect the nutrition we give our plants, and it’s all done in-house. Continuous experimenting through our R&D platform has provided us the knowledge to continuously improve our plant nutrition recipes and create the environment for maximum genetic performance. Healthy plants make for an even healthier product and you can truly taste and feel the difference.







PESTICIDE FREE




You will find absolutely ZERO synthetic or harmful pesticides used on our products, our pest management is as natural as it comes. So what’s the secret to our system? Ladybugs! Their voracious appetites help keep our cannabis plants healthy by consuming mites and aphids. This symbiotic relationship is a great alternative to harmful pesticides and we are proud to include them in our cultivation.







HARVESTED AT PEAK POTENCY




Our dedicated team of post-harvest specialists harvest our plants at the climax of each flush before hand-trimming each flower bud individually. From there, our flowers are cured to perfection, tested daily to ensure moisture levels reach the apex of each strain’s terpene profile. The result?

510,"Our Mission
 
Kiva Confections products are crafted from premium ingredients and skillfully combined with California cannabis. Since our beginning in 2010, our goal was to create an edible that redefined what a cannabis confection ought to be. By applying art and science to ensure a deliciously consistent experience every time, we continue to deliver on that mission today.
 
History

 
Kiva Confections was launched in 2010, when the infused products field was wide open for innovation. Kiva’s founders, Scott Palmer and Kristi Knoblich Palmer, were a young couple looking for high quality and trustworthy products for their own consumption, when they discovered a distinct lack in the marketplace. The edible market was desperately underserved- products were untested, unlabeled, and inconsistently potent, which the founders became committed to changing. By working with experienced cannabis cultivators, and expert chocolatiers, Kiva Confections was launched with a commitment to efficacy, food safety, and business integrity. Scott and Kristi endeavored to create a safe, consistent and delicious cannabis edible- and to make their product accessible to a wide array of consumers through premium branding. They thought about the user experience at every step of the process – from the quality of the raw materials and ingredient sources, to the packaging design and the information it conveyed, to the experience our consumers enjoyed. The founders believe that cannabis is safe, natural, and effective - and from the start they wanted to empower users to consume it wisely and effectively for their greatest health and well-being.
 
 
 
 
 
Products
 
From our premium sourcing for our THC-rich chocolate Kiva Bars, our whole plant CBD approach for our 1:1 Bars, to our convenient, best-selling chocolate Terra Bites, to our microdosed, sugar-free and vegan Petra mints and experience-based Camino Gummies, Kiva is dedicated to leading the way in creating delicious, consistent, and safe edibles.

Cannabis Movement, State of Mind and Lifestyle

La Mala is a Swiss craft Cannabis Brand producing premium handcrafted products.

 

Our Mission

La Mala is the realization for a lifelong passion for weed.

Aiming to become a leading company in the cannabis industry, it always comes out with new ideas, attempting to make this world a better place to thrive.

 

History

La Mala was established in 2018 opening a little Boutique in the center of the City Locarno, and began in the same way many great companies do: a passion for a plant that grew into something more. The founding team could not find a satisfactory Cannabis product that met their high standards of quality. Dissatisfied, they invested their time, resources, and expert cannabis knowledge to find and create the flowers for themselves and others, collaborating, from the beginning, in exclusivity with another Farm company named High Garden Sarl carrying, precisely like La Mala, the same expectation of excellence. 

 

Products

La Mala Weed Shop offers a vast range of recreational and medical marijuana options including edibles, tinctures, flowers, concentrates, and topicals. It provides a careful selection of artisanal, and other excellent Brand products. You’ll also find everything you need to start your own cultivation where and whenever you want.

From Grow to Head-shop.

 

Lab Testing

All our craft products have been checked for quality and concentration values in external laboratories.




Production

Outdoor: We grow our plants according to permaculture methods on the shores of Lake Geneva. Therefore, they develop into an ecosystem that includes many animal and plant species. Wild bees live in neighboring hives and we want to protect them. We are committed to ensuring that our cannabis production has a positive impact on this environment. We have only used organic and natural fertilizers and treatments to respect this commitment.

Indoor: To avoid overfeeding, each plant is grown with the appropriate input of nutrients and is rinsed with clear water for at least two weeks at the end of its flowering.

During the drying process the entire plant is suspended in a dark room for another two weeks, under controlled humidity. This is a complicated process that takes a lot of space, but by doing so it increments the juice in the buds, which in turn give more substance to create sugars during the drying process. The result is a more tasteful product. 

The buds are all stored in glass jars with humidity controllers for at least two months. Then, each bud is trimmed by hand with stainless steel scissors.

The combination of these treatments makes our products pleasant and sweet. The smoke is light and full of their own fruity aromas. Reason for this are terpenes, which are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, the essential oils of plants, that are responsible for the distinct smell and taste of each strain.

There are no added flavors.",https://www.facebook.com/La-Mala-Weed-Shop-1957051084623177/?ref=bookmarks,16,ad/addf884d6115630f7f1ca6a83af7975759c165da.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/007/162/avatar/original/1558703342-La_Mala_.jpg,la_mala_weeda,La Mala,5,0,la-mala,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/la-mala,http://www.lamala.ch/,,,,,,,,,,,

3239,"Veganismo llevado a la máxima expresión: Tattoos
 
En la teoría, el veganismo es entendido, como práctica que rechaza la utilización y consumo de todos los productos y servicios de origen animal, incluyendo los tattoos.
 
Elveganismoes unaforma de entender la vida querechaza cualquier tipo de explotación animal.Contrariamente a lo que mucha gente piensa, el veganismo no implica exclusivamente un tipo de dieta concreta. Existen otras facetas de la vida humana, como en el sector textil o cosmético, por ejemplo, en los que también se utiliza a los animales para el propio interés, sin tener en cuenta su sufrimiento. Muchos de los productos estéticos de grandes marcas son previamente testados en animales, así como se fabrican prendas de vestir a partir de la piel de distintas especies.
 
¿Qué supone el veganismo real?
 
Paraentender lafilosofía veganaal completo,hay que pensar en una forma de vida demáximo respeto al mundo animal.También se trata de una corriente quese opone, a ladiscriminación según la especie,oespecismo. De hecho, esta es considerada la principal causa de la explotación animal.
 
Con todo esto, y de nuevo remarcando que elveganismono solo se reduce al tipo de dieta, tenemos como conclusión que el veganismo implica varias cuestiones.
 
Alimentación
 
Ladieta veganano incluyeningún producto animal ni producido por animales. No sólo se evita la carne y el pescado, sino quetampoco se consumen huevos, leche ni miel, ni derivados o productos que los contengan. Losveganosactúan así porque sostienen que los animales son sacrificados prematuramente y maltratados, siendo utilizados como alimento o aprovechaando sus recursos.
 
Elveganismopone en su lugar, los productos vegetales como la principal fuente de alimento.
 
Existe cierta controversia por algunos colectivos acerca delriesgo de no consumir productos de origen animal debido a las carencias que éstos presentan en sustancias como:grasas, el calcio, el yodo, el hierro, las proteínas o las vitaminas D y B12. Aunque siempre se pueden complementar o implementar los alimentos para suplir estas carencias. La raíz de la elección de ladieta vegana, no es otra, que elprofundo respeto que se profesa al mundo animal.
 
Téxtil
 
Haytejidos como la lana, el cuero o la seda que provienen directamente de los animales. En la misma línea de contraposición a la explotación animal, los veganos tienden a no utilizar prendas de estos tejidos.
 
Cuando hablamos del veganismo nos referimos a una práctica a donde debemosabstenernos no solamente de comer sino también de no consumir productos de origen animal. Esta práctica se fundamenta en una actitud derechazo ala explotación animal como producto de consumo, por eso resultará difícil ver a un vegano presenciando una función de circo o ingresando a un zoológico, lugares a donde también existe explotación animal.
 
Cosmética y Tattoos
 
Elveganismotambiéndescarta el uso de productos testados con animales. Muchas cremas, tratamientos faciales y cosméticos utilizan este método antes de comercializarse, por lo que elveganismoevita su uso. En estos casos, con revisar la lista de componentes de este tipo de productos e informarse sobre otros de carácter natural que cumplan las mismas funciones, es suficiente.
 
En la sociedad actual, a veces es difícil mantener estos valores,como es el caso de los tatuajesya que, por ejemplo, algunas tintas negras que se utilizan para tatuar se hacen, principalmente, conhuesos de animaleso glicerina y con parte degrasa animal.
 
Lostatuajes veganosconsisten básicamente en realizar un tatuaje utilizando netamente elementos que no provengan de animales o en los que se haya utilizado animales para conseguirlos. Para eso se deberán utilizartintas que estén hechas con glicerina sintética o vegetaly que se hayan utilizado otro tipo de cenizas para su composición. De hechohay muchas tintas en el mercado que cumplen los valores veganosy que, además, estánconsideradas menos“toxicas”que las tradicionales. Además en el resultado final del tatuaje no se ve realmenteninguna diferenciaya que son muy similares a las tintas tradicionales, y si nadie te dice que sonveganas, tampoco te darías cuenta. Otro de los elementos más utilizados a parte de las tintas, son las vaselinas y lubricantes utilizados para favorecer el deslizamiento de la aguja sobre la piel, y también éstos hoy en día los podemos encontrar de origen natural y/o vegetal.
 
Una vez realizado el tatuaje también es importante tener presente elproceso de curación, ya que las cremas o bálsamos que utilizamos muchas vecestambiéncontienencomponentes animales.Es aquí dondeLeaf Projuega un papel relevante y definitivo dentro delmovimiento vegano. Hay un montón de cuidados,muchos ungüentos y lociones existentes en el mercadoque incluyen ingredientes de orígen animal como son la cera de abejas, lanolina, así como hígado de bacalao, etc; por no hablar de la inmensa lista de componentes químicos de procedencia no natural.Leaf Prorechaza esos ingredientes y ofrece una alternativa para cura...",,21,ba/bae67f07dcd90561e4699c1000c58c656f544e26.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/239/avatar/original/1505317352-leaf1200x1200.jpg,leafprotattoobalm,Leaf Pro,0,0,leaf-pro,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/leaf-pro,https://leafprotattoobalm.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural Ingredients, Consistently Amazing.
 
 
 
Legal Beverages changes the game in quality cannabis drinks. Offering one-of-a-kind marijuana sparkling tonics, Legal Beverages’ blend of delicious flavors, potent strains, and convenient on-the-go consumption are ready to go whenever you are. At a party, watching a movie, or hiking through the wilderness, Legal Beverages is on hand to enhance any experience and pleasurably stimulate all the senses.
 
History:
 
Legal Beverages’ parent company, Mirth Provisions, got their start in 2013 in Oregon with a mission to develop products that embodied the professional and positive sides of the cannabis industry. When searching for a field in which to drive their passion for excellence, they realized there weren’t many healthy or pleasant alternatives to the harm of smoking cannabis. An idea struck: offer a cannabis-infused soda that tastes delicious and was discreet enough to consume anywhere. Thus, Legal Beverages launched in 2014 to provide their new creation to the marijuana-enjoying masses in the Pacific Northwest. Overcoming the trials and hurdles of ever-changing legislation, Legal Beverages has today expanded to Washington and Oregon’s cannabis market, with plans to distribute to Colorado and California in the next year.
 
Process:
 
Legal Beverages’ products are formulated using all natural ingredients, locally sourced whenever possible from vendors in the Pacific Northwest. Following their brand’s ethos of excellence, Legal Beverages uses solvent-free CO2 extraction processes to extract the oil from top quality cannabis grown in Washington. Then, they infused the oil with their homemade beverage recipes, offering a variety of delicious and refreshing flavors sure to please any palate.
 
Products:
 
Four different and unique flavors make up the selection of Legal Beverages’ delicious cannabis-infused sparkling sodas. Their Rainer Cherry-Sativa pairs well with parties and day time events, while their Lemon Ginger-Indica massages the body and frees the mind. Their refreshing Pomegranate offers a zesty Sativa experience, while their Cranberry options provides a balanced CBD: THC ratio, perfect for optimal healing.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Legal Beverages lab tests and quality controls each batch of their products, committed to providing their patients and clients only exceptionally natural and potent marijuana products.
 
Networks:
 
To date, Legal Beverages’ products have lined the shelves of Washington and Oregon dispensaries, featured in the well known High End Marketplace in Vancouver, Washington and New Amsterdam in Southwest Washington.

Lemon Tree, the legendary Strain, descends from the Santa Cruz mountains to delight connoisseurs far and wide. With a passion for both cannabis’ healing properties and the potential for a distinctly pleasurable experience, Lemon Tree is proud to stand at the forefront of the marijuana industry’s revolutionary emergence. When a person goes home with Lemon Tree in hand, they know they’re buying not only a product but an experience.
 
History:
 
Lemon Tree originated decades ago as a unique cross of Lemon Skunk and Sour Diesel whose caretakers worked to preserve its terpene profile, potency, and delicious flavor. After years of growing and tending the bud, Lemon Tree’s founders would deliver their precious strain to local dispensaries and patients, who all adored the euphoria Lemon Tree provided. As regulations in California changed, they decided they wanted to put a name to the herb, and in 2014, Lemon Tree officially began, offering their unique genetics in flower, concentrate, and vape cartridge form. Since their launch, they’ve expanded throughout northern California and are slowly reaching down to offer Lemon Tree to the cannabis connoisseur community.
 
Products:
 
Years of perfecting have gone into Lemon Tree’s potency and genetics, offering cannabis enthusiasts across the board a consistently excellent, Hybrid experience. Lemon Tree provides a euphoric high that mixes elements of both Sativa and Indica that’s apparent in each of their strain’s forms. Refining their processes, Lemon Tree extracts their flower’s properties into clean cannabinoid form, filling their cartridges with the same signature experience. Their growers only pull a certain amount with each harvest, and Lemon Tree’s connoisseur status attracts strain hunters across California.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Lemon Tree tests all of their products at SC Labs, to ensure their signature strain’s complete level of high-quality potency, terpene profile, and purity of any pesticides or substances.
 
Networks:
 
Currently, Lemon Tree can be found in Northern California regions, including Sacramento, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and extending down to Fresno. Prominent dispensaries with their flower include PCF Modesto, Green Door and Canna Cruz. Lemon Tree also collaborates with Gilded Extracts, Gold Drop and Blue River Terpenes to create their concentrates.",,2001,26/2603663a2462468302d56da6aabe72ab27d5eba7.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/554/avatar/original/1527036197-The-Lemon-Tree_logo-v2.jpg,,Lemon Tree,4.86904764175415,33,the-lemon-tree,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/the-lemon-tree,,,,,,,,,,,,

LEVEL is a science-driven cannabis company at the forefront of cannabinoid research and innovation that is passionate about helping to guide humans with the information and products they need to make informed decisions and take action. We launched LEVEL with one goal in mind: to create unique, targeted effects-based cannabis products by formulating cannabinoids in ratios not accessible from the plant alone.




Better Than an Edible




LEVEL products are formulated from 100% cannabis-only cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids, maintaining the maximum fidelity of the cannabis plant. There are no superfluous ingredients. LEVEL products are vegan, contain no gluten or sugar, and are calorie free.




LEVEL’s unique formulations mean that the majority of the delta-9 THC in our tablets does not metabolize into 11-hydroxy-THC. Instead, it remains true to the fidelity of a delta-9 THC experience (similar to a classic high).




Consumers experience an authentic, clean, functional high that maximizes the targeted effects and therapeutic benefits.




Delivering Endless Possibilities




The vast majority of cannabis products on the market only contain delta-9 THC and/or CBD. Our product lineup offers unique formulations with high concentrations of emergent cannabinoids like CBG, CBDa, CBN, THCa, THCv, and delta-8 THC.




So, whether you’re looking to focus on a project, get a good night’s sleep, prevent a hangover, relieve stress, or soothe aches and pains, there’s a unique cannabinoid profile for that. We crafted the range of doses and intake methods we offer intending to provide the tools to help you discover what your body responds to best—no matter your experience level with cannabis. Ultimately, we hope to not only help you find the right solution for any given situation but assist in a lifelong journey of self-discovery.

We put our first roots down four years ago in Washington, DC, and we've been growing ever since. Opening our first Liberty Cannabis stores in Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania means bringing our mission to life. We're more dedicated than ever to providing individualized care, innovative products and exceptional experiences to our patients and partners.
 
We're different than most. 
 
We're driven by two things. The first is our passion for medical cannabis. The second is our commitment to the values that lead us into this business in the first place and still guide us today. Those values include QUALITY (industry-leading, medical-grade products informed by our seasoned team), LEADERSHIP (the highest levels of experience and professionalism), INNOVATION (tech-savvy and forward-looking), EDUCATION (informing customers on treatments and trends) and COMPASSION (an uncommon standard of care).
 
ARRANGED BY FEELING: With dozens of flower strains and other products, like extracts, tinctures and capsules, we offer more options than most cannabis brands. Some patients and partners like to dive into all of the strain names and scientific details. For everyone else, we’ve organized all of our products by how they make a customer feel. Our color spectrum, wing system and category names guide Liberty’s partners and patients through the range from sativas (most energizing) to indicas (most relaxing). 
 
VITALITY: Energizing sativa strains
Our “Vitality” suite of strains (full sativas) are on the energizing end of the spectrum. That means they’re ideal for daytime use, offering an overall invigorating and clear headed effect without getting in the way of your agenda.
 
CLARITY: Uplifting sativa hybrids
Our “Clarity” strains are sativa hybrids, slightly more mellow than our “Vitality” offerings, but still on the uplifting side of the scale. They’re typically best used for quick relief, improving focus and creativity throughout the day
 
HARMONY: Balanced sativa/indica hybrids
Our “Harmony” suite of strains are 50/50 crosses of a sativa and an indica. They tend to be popular for their versatility, especially among newer patients, balancing the euphoric effects of “Vitality” with the potency of “Serenity.”
 
TRANQUILITY: Relaxing indica hybrids
Liberty’s “Tranquility” strains and products, which are indica hybrids, relax the mind and body. They’re a good way for patients to unwind after work, known to calm your nerves and ease your pain without putting you to sleep.
 
SERENITY: Potent indica strains

​

LIGER BALM is dedicated to bringing wellness to the world through ultra-concentrated terpene rich CBD oil derived from all natural, high quality industrial hemp. It is legal in all 50 states and is 100% Organic, Gluten Free, Non GMO Hemp and has no heavy metals or insecticides, and is batch tested using Ultra Performance Convergence Chromatography.

​

We follow only the best industry standards, making our Hemp Oil the most effective and the highest quality on the market today. Our proprietary nanotechnology makes our products 9x more bio-available than anything else on the market, making our products faster and more efficiently absorbed by the body.

 

LIGER BALM's nanotechnology represents the ultimate refinement of hemp oil concentrate. Our unique oil gives unmatched particle size, putting cannabinoids in their most bio-active state. This minute size gives the cannabinoids a much greater surface area. For example; Picture a basketball full of BB's sitting on your kitchen floor. It only covers a small portion of the floor. Now, picture the basketball breaking open and all those BB's spilling out. They spread out over the entire floor. This is what our proprietary nano system does — it breaks large lipid balls full of cannabinoids down thousands of times to the molecular level. The smaller the particle size, the easier it is for the cells of your body to absorb it. Every time you cut the particle size in half, you increase its surface area. Think of the exponential surface area when you reduce particle sizes hundreds of times. This process will not only make hemp oil concentrate much more potent, it will make delivery time to the cells a matter of seconds; not hours!

It’s the grower not the strain
 
Stoney Ranch bridges the gap between satisfaction and quality, and due to their reputation of making strains that patients love only adds to that satisfaction and quality. Their expert growers want patients to taste the Stoney Ranch difference; their flowers boast phenomenal flavor and aroma that cannot be replicated anywhere else. Taste, smell, and consistency are Stoney Ranch’s trademark, and patients can rely on Stoney Ranch for flowers that have been grown to their fullest potential. Stoney Ranch flowers are for the pheno-philes, who desire decadent terpenes from a specialized grow.
 
History: Stoney Ranch has laid in the ground work in the cannabis industry, and the founder has seen first hand the injustice the marijuana community have endured. Research and development for Stoney Ranch began in 2007, and branding started four years later. The founder was a pro surfer and needed medicinal cannabis to perform at the top level. Marijuana was an instantaneous love, and in 1994 the founder visited Amsterdam and saw a grow for the first time. Later, on a trip to Costa Rica, the founder met someone in the marijuana industry, who taught him how to raise flowers. The founder impressed his teacher with his first run, and it was extremely apparent that he had a knack for marijuana. The only problem was he only ever wanted to smoke his own weed, other strains for other grows just weren’t the same.
 
Although being endowed with fantastic talent and having a genuine love for marijuana, the founder's journey to develop Stoney Ranch was not a perfect one. While in Humboldt they had to deal with forced entries, and arrest despite following state legal regulations. The founder knew full well the determinants of harsh marijuana policy and punishment, as a child his father was caught with cannabis and was out of his life for twenty years as a result. Rising above the issues that presented themselves over the years while staying in love with cannabis is what shaped Stoney Ranch into the connoisseur quality brand that it is today.
 
Products: Stoney Ranch is the premium grow specialist, and their line-up of incredible cannabis proves it. Take their Girl Scout Cookies for example, which patients actually believe to be a Stoney Ranch original. Though Stoney Ranch can assure you; it’s the grower, not the strain. Their amazing attention to marijuana has earned them the best crops, resulting in the best buds in return. Whether a fan of Green Crack or not, patients have fallen for Stoney Ranch’s grow of this strain. Although not usually a favorite strain amongst the community, when Stoney Ranch grew their version it became the #1 Sativa. What patients really gwak over is Stoney Ranch’s Orange Cookies, which elicits a burst of tangy, citrus flavor and euphoric, hybrid effects.
 
Process: The founder seeks out the best genes of cannabis available, pheno-hunting for plants that yield the best buds around. Stoney Ranch has run into the issue of clubs asking them to rename regular strains of flower they bring in. Their phenomenal phenotypes and excellent growing conditions create strains that are far beyond what the average patient is used to, Stoney Ranch brings out the aroma and flavor of the flowers. Their marijuana crops are grown without plant growth regulators (PGR) or any harsh chemicals. Stoney Ranch focuses on the quality of the yield over the amount harvested, ensuring that patients get the best buds they’ve ever tried.
 
Lab Testing: Patients can rest assured the same due diligence that guides Stoney Ranch’s grows are carried through to their dedication to safety and transparency. Stoney Ranch is proud to provide high quality, lab tested flowers and concentrates. All of Stoney Ranch flowers and products are tested through Sequoia Analytical Labs, for potency, residual solvents, pesticide screening, microbials, and terpene profile.
 
Networks: Stoney Ranch is proud to have built their brand on the premise of being dedicated to providing the best cannabis to consumers as well as being inclusive and collaborative in their efforts. Stoney Ranch’s incredible cannabis is available across California. They can be found in the Sacramento Area, East Bay, Chico and Los Angeles. Stoney Ranch is in the process of amping up their productions, to provide their high-quality cannabis to patients in other areas. Sacramento patients can find Stoney Ranch flowers at Doctor's Orders, or Alternative Medical Center. Los Angeles tokers can pick up Stoney Ranch buds from Top Shelf California. And Bay Area patients can get their Stoney Ranch flowers from Propicanna. Other cannabusiness that carry Stoney Ranch are Golden Health Wellness, Token Farms, Emerald Cloud Official, and Green Gold. Stoney Ranch is working on partnerships with extractors and edible chefs to fuse their top-quality marijuana with other enthusiasts.

3188,"Stratos is a longtime, premium manufacturer of cannabis and hemp-infused products, using only the best ingredients on the market and non-GMO Colorado-grown cannabis and hemp. The Stratos team considers uptake, absorbency, flavor, and convenience when creating each product. Their scientific approach and precision-based manufacturing processes ensure that customers have the same experience every single time. 




With several strain-type specific products as well as a variety of CBD/THC ratios, there is a Stratos product for any mood, desire, or need. Stratos' ingestible, smokeable, and vape lines never introduce any supplements into their formulations. They instead utilize the power of full spectrum oil to elicit deeper, more nuanced, mind-and-body effects. Stratos' full-spectrum oil maintains all of the properties that the plants have to offer rather than distilling oil down to one or two cannabinoids as other companies do. 




TINCTURES

Stratos tinctures were created using a high-shear mixing technology to reduce the size of the cannabis molecules, allowing for faster onset and maximum sublingual absorption. The dropper applicator allows for an easy micro-dosing option. 




SALVES

Carefully selected essential oils are combined with full-spectrum cannabis extract to boost the healing benefits of Stratos’ infused topicals. 




TABLETS

Stratos tablets are designed to dissolve quickly and are easily absorbed into the body when compared to gel capsules with oil. Additionally, tablets can be halved or quartered for an easy micro-dosing option. 




DABTABS

Stratos’ cannabis concentrates are infused into eco-friendly, vapeable, ceramic tablets. These precision-dosed 50mg tabs offer a pure product free of additives and fillers. The ceramic casing provides a buffer between the flame and the oil allowing for a true-vapor experience as opposed to the combustion required with most vape products.




SLOW BURN INFUSED PREROLLS

The Stratos Slow burn prerolls are infused with full spectrum oil, a process that makes them burn evenly and last twice as long as average prerolls. They're one of the only infused pre-rolls to include whole flower (not trim) & maintain same flower/oil combo (i.e. wedding cake whole flower mixed with wedding cake oil). 




HEMP LINE

All of Stratos’ hemp products, which also include tablets, tinctures, and topicals, are available in full spectrum or CBD isolate formulations through www.stratoscbd.com. If you want the benefits of CBD without the high, this is the product for you!

11394,"SUM is a sublingual tablet -- not a tincture and not quite an edible. Edibles are swallowed, sending the cannabinoids on a slow, inhospitable journey through the stomach and GI tract. This process alters and diminishes cannabinoids, resulting in only a small fraction getting to your system (low bioavailability). Oils and tinctures go under the tongue yet absorb so poorly that most is swallowed, making them not much better than an edible. SUM is absorbed through the capillaries under your tongue, bypassing the metabolic process and absorbing much better than oils. This results in fast onset (around 10 minutes) and higher bioavailability. All in a minty rapid-dissolve tablet.

6951,"THE STORY BEHIND SSSC
 
Sam the Skunkman
 
The Super Sativa Seed Club is one of the very first seed banks in the world. In the mid eighties every grower knew the SSSC. It all started when ‘Sam the Skunkman’ gave Karel Schelfhout, one of the founders of SSSC and former squatter, the original Haze and Skunk#01 after he moved from California. Karel used Sam’s genetics to create some of the very illustrious strains that later became Super Sativa Seed Club.
 
Nevil
 
The only seed bank that was around before SSSC was from Nevil called ""the Seedbank"". Founded by Nevil Schoenmaker, the Seedbank was the first international operating seedbank in the world. Nevil combined the 10 original Haze seeds, that he received from Sam the Skunkman, with the seeds he collected on a strain hunt in Afghanistan to start his famous seed collection. The Seedbank is best known for the Nevil’s Haze strain, but Nevil was also the first to use the infamous Ruderalis strain in his breeding work. The seeds that Karel received from Nevil, added to the ones he received from Sam, became the first breeding and the foundation of Super Sativa Seed Club.
 
High times
 
Between 1985 and 1987 SSSC genetics pushed the limits of breeding and growing all over the world. When High Times magazine published a cover story about the Dutch seed bank, sales exploded. In less than two years SSSC sold millions of seeds in the USA, Europe and Asia. After two very successful years the adventure ended. The founders went their separate ways and most of the SSSC seed collection got lost.
 
Legendary genetics
 
‘Weeds do not perish’ is a literal translation of the Dutch expression ‘onkruid vergaat niet’. And this is exactly what happened. After the adventure of SSSC ended, Karel saved one very important plant, a daughter of the original Haze and Skunk#01. Karel kept cuttings of this precious plant for more than 30 years and named her ‘Old School Haze’. The remaining SSSC genetics are the stuff of legends, even now many varieties carry DNA from the original SSSC seeds. All plants with a flavour of Haze or Skunk probably have grandparents born from SSSC seeds.
 
Keep the legend alive
 
In the 90’s Karel and his team shifted their focus towards genetic preservation and the breeding of new cannabis strains for the Coffee shops in Amsterdam. At thesame time Karel worked on developing advanced indoor growing techniques. This made him an authority in the field of elite genetics, breeding and cultivation. It was around this time that Karel’s son Kees, who had been working and growing his own plants in Barcelona, came to join him. His products are a great success in the Cannabis Social Clubs, especially his signature strain of Karel’s Haze. Kees represents a new generation of breeders. Working with great passion and the ambition to keep the legend alive.
 
Karel
 
Back in the eighties Karel was part of an underground scene of squatters, where smoking pot was an integral part of the lifestyle. Curious about the possibilities of growing the weed themselves, the first growers appeared. These pioneers were looking for new techniques to grow quality marihuana indoors. Karel started experimenting with indoor grow facilities in abandoned houses. He used professional growing lamps, developed mineral fertilisers and grew the plants on rock wool. This technique of growing without soil was copied from the nearby glasshouse agricultural industry.

Kees
 
Kees always wondered where his father purchased his weed with that old school quality taste. In 2015 he discovered that his father had been secretly growing OSH in a hidden place for all these years. Being a breeder himself, Kees got convinced by the idea that the old genetics were very valuable. He set out to reintroduce the original taste and quality of Haze. Thanks to his efforts, SSSC is now able to sell original OSH seeds, in addition to the many other special genetics from the old seed collection.
 
JOIN THE CLUB
 
After more than 30 years, the Super Sativa Seed Club has returned to write a new chapter in its amazing story. SSSC is a real club with passionate breeders from all over the world as its members.

„supHerb“ steht für qualitativ hochwertige Hanfprodukte aus natürlicher Erzeugung. Unser Auftrag ist Cannabis innerhalb der Gesellschaft zu einer breiten Akzeptanz zu verhelfen und seinen Ruf aus der Ecke der Illegalität zu holen. Dass Cannabis auch mit Spaß zu tun hat, soll dabei natürlich nicht vergessen werden. Aber heute muss niemand mehr zweifelhafte Qualität zu nicht nachvollziehbaren Preisen illegal erwerben und damit eine Vielzahl von Zwischenhändlern mitfinanzieren. Wir haben die Vermarktung und den Vertrieb von legalen Cannabisprodukten in Leopoldstadt, Wien, Österreich und dem Rest der Welt zu unserem Business gemacht. In unserem Online-Shop und mit persönlicher Beratung an unserem Point of Sale in der Praterstraße 14 bieten wir euch eine große Auswahl an Produkten in hoher Qualität und zu fairen Preisen an. Unsere gesamte Palette wird unter kontrollierten Rahmenbedingungen gewonnen und vertrieben.
 
Verantwortungsbewusst und legal
 
Die neue Generation CBD kommt gänzlich ohne hoch potenten THC Sorten aus. Wir bewegen uns mit unserer gesamten Produktpalette im legalen Raum und distanzieren uns dezidiert von kriminellen Umfeldern, die mit der Beschaffung von illegalen Cannabis-Substanzen in Zusammenhang stehen. Es gibt bei uns auch keine Mindestabnahme-Mengen und wir sagen ausdrücklich NEIN zu harten Drogen. Der verantwortliche Umgang mit unseren Produkten wird von uns sehr ernst genommen. Dementsprechend verkaufen wir unser legales Gras und Hasch ausnahmslos an Personen über 18 Jahren und wollen dafür sorgen, dass diese Vorgehensweise gesetzlich verankert wird.
 
Sicherheit durch Labor-Analyse
 
Unsere Aromaprodukte sind vom Institut für Hanfanalytik Labor-getestet. Ihr könnt euch die Analysen zu den verschiedenen Sorten bei den Produktfotos ansehen. Bitte beachtet, dass die Ergebnisse mit 0,877 multipliziert werden müssen um auf einen korrekten Wert zu kommen.

2491,"The SuperStrains seedscompany was established in 2010.
In fact the company activities took place for numerous years under the supervision of nutrient producer HY-PRO, becoming independent just was a logical consequence.
What gave the biggest push to independence was the introduction of the feminizing process, the seeds activitie’s needed to be concentrated and controlled independently.
HY-PRO’s seeds division became SuperStrains.

Where before the millennium crossing and breeding was the main activity, after 2000 it was the feminizing process which became a specialty at SuperStrains. The combination of those disciplines is credit for the leading position SuperStrains takes in their area today. Years of work in crossing and updating specie’s, creating endless combinations for growth, bloom, taste, smell, strength etc., had lead to the genetic result which all over the world is known as Amnesia.

Here can be mentioned that over 20 years, not one variety appeared which speaks out as this legendary plant.

In the present time, SuperStrains’ focus is mainly on genetic heritage and the predictability of the matter. The results of these efforts will mainly benefit the medical sector.

La división de semillas de HY-PRO se convirtió en SuperStrains. 
 
Años de trabajo en el cruce y la actualización de la especie, creando infinitas combinaciones para el crecimiento, la floración, el gusto, el olfato, la fuerza, etc, ha llevado al resultado genético que en todo el mundo se conoce como Amnesia. 
 
Aquí se puede mencionar que más de 20 años no apareció una variedad que habla como esta legendaria planta. 
 
En la actualidad, SuperStrains se centra principalmente en el patrimonio genético y la previsibilidad de la materia.

History
 
Sweet Releaf™ was developed out of necessity. The founder formulated a marijuana topical for a family member dealing with severe pain. After a terrible car accident, injuries left this family member with a potential lifetime dealing with pain management. That was when the founder got to work to develop a natural solution to chronic ailments without the use of harmful pharmaceuticals. The result was Sweet Releaf™, a line of marijuana-infused body butters that soothe pain and calm inflammation.
 
 
 
Process
 
Sweet Releaf™ creates their body butter by hand usingf ingredients that nourish your skin. Their formulation begins with a blend of coconut oil, shea butter, cacao butter, candelilla and essential oils. Then, Sweet Releaf™ introduces the cannabinoids into their body butter. They collect their trichomes through live resin extraction, freezing fresh cannabis flowers then remove the resinous glands containing relief. The final product is a body butter with enchanting aromatics and even better effects.

Sweet Seeds se complace un año más en presentar sus aromáticas variedades feminizadas, fruto de una esmerada labor de selección y crianza.
 
Esta temporada 2016 en Sweet Seeds seguimos celebrando nuestro 10º aniversario y queremos agradecerte estos 11 años con 1 y 2 semillas de regalo en todos los paquetes de 3 y 5 semillas respectivamente. Puedes consultar la duración de esta promoción en sweetseeds.es.
 
En Sweet Seeds nos sentimos orgullosos de ser uno de los pioneros bancos de semillas que han contribuido a que hoy en día las semillas feminizadas sean las preferidas por los cannabicultores del mundo entero. Genéticas de alta calidad y alta producción, muy resinosas y especialmente aromáticas, con una feminidad que ronda el 99,9%, y con un porcentaje de germinación superior al 95%, este es nuestro compromiso de calidad con nuestros clientes.
 
Sweet Seeds hemos sido pioneros en la investigación y desarrollo de las modernas variedades autoflorecientes. En los últimos años hemos presentado nuevas familias dentro de este tipo de variedades, como nuestras autoflorecientes de flor roja “Red Family”, o nuestras autoflorecientes de talla alta como las “Big Devil® Family” o las genéticas “XL”.
 
Recientemente también presentamos nuestras “F1 Fast Version®”, que son versiones fotodependientes de clásicos de nuestro catálogo pero de floración muy rápida.
 
Esta temporada continuamos con nuestra re-evolución de las autoflorecientes y presentamos una nueva variedad autofloreciente de 4ª generación, la SWS57 (Blow Mind Auto®). En cuanto a variedades fotodependientes presentamos la SWS58 (Crystal Candy®), una genética de exquisito aroma y espectacular producción de resina.
 
Pensando en las compras colectivas de semillas y en las asociaciones de usuarios de cannabis, la temporada 2015 presentamos nuevos paquetes en formatos de 25 y 100 semillas, esta temporada ampliamos el número de variedades disponibles en estos formatos.
 
Todos los paquetes de 25 semillas tienen un precio de 100€ (la semilla sale a 4€), y todos los paquetes de 100 semillas 350€ (la semilla sale a 3,5€).
 
La pasada temporada 2014 presentamos nuestro paquete “Sweet Mix Auto” con la intención de ofrecer semillas autoflorecientes de calidad superior a un precio económico y adaptado a los actuales tiempos de crisis, para completar nuestra oferta de semillas económicas de alta calidad la temporada 2015 también presentamos un nuevo paquete “Sweet Mix Feminizadas” con una mezcla de 10 semillas elegidas al azar entre todas las variedades fotodependientes de Sweet Seeds. Estos paquetes “Mix” están disponibles al precio de 35€, la semilla sale a 3,5€, posiblemente las semillas feminizadas de alta calidad más económicas del mercado.

Schnell haben wir feststellen müssen, dass die Inhaltsstoffe der CBD- haltigen Produkte, die in der Schweiz erhältlich sind, nicht standardisiert sind. Zwar wird der THC- und CBD- Gehalt regelmässig überprüft. Welche Beimengungen und Hilfsstoffe darin enthalten sind, ist aber oft nicht nachvollziehbar. So gibt es beispielsweise Extrakte, welche aus China importiert werden, wo Pflanzen oft unter dubiosen Umständen angebaut und verarbeitet werden. Pestizidrückstände und Schwermetallbelastungen in den Extrakten können die Folgen sein. Da die Analyse dieser Rückstände sehr aufwändig und teuer ist, haben wir es uns zum Ziel gesetzt, nur Produkte aus bestem, unter kontrollierten Bedingungen in der Schweiz erzeugtem Hanf herzustellen und zu vertreiben.

Born at a time when almost everything in Amsterdam was a mix of Northern Lights, Skunk and Shiva in various proportions, T.H. Seeds has worked long and hard to bring new stable varieties onto the market. T.H.Seeds was the seed company responsible for bringing the Original Bubblegum from the States, and was the first to sell the Bubblegum seeds (see New York Times, Feb. 1994). These Bubble Gum genetics helped numerous Coffeeshops win many High Times Cannabis Cups over the years.
 
Following the Bubble Gum™, T.H.Seeds® brought the S.A.G.E. ™(Sativa Afghani Genetic Equilibrium™) from the high mountains of central California to Holland. Named ""S.A.G.E.""™ because of its distinctive spicy smell and taste, this plant's Haze-y flavor and high will fool you into thinking it is a pure Haze variety. But when you grow it you will not experience the low yields of all other Haze varieties. The large yields you get come from the Afghani side, but without overpowering this plant's superior Haze flavor. For two years the THC percentage of the 50 varieties entered by all the coffeeshops and seed companies entered in the High Times Cannabis Cup was established. The S.A.G.E.™ scored 3rd(1998), and 2nd(1999) highest THC with over 20%. Both years this THC ranking was higher then any of the Coffeeshop or Seed Company Cannabis Cup winners! And the one year (1999) the S.A.G.E.™ water hash was entered in the Cannabis Cup it won again. At the 2014 Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam all the entries were tested again and S.A.G.E. scored a whopping 25.06% THC.",,183,df/df0d89d784253c25289575f2abb60cd249e14917.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/615/avatar/original/THSeedsTransparency_logo.jpg,,TH Seeds®,5,1,th-seeds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/th-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,

THC Design is pleased to supply clean, safe medical and recreational cannabis for all walks of life. With THC Design’s premium cannabis the 420 community feels great no matter what strain they smoke.
 
 
 
History
 
It’s in their DNA
 
The founder has a longstanding relationship with cannabis and comes from three generations of cultivators. He had been around cannabis for as long as he could remember, it would seem growing flowers is in his DNA. After moving to Boulder Creek, California, the founder was able to begin a new phase in his cannabis career. THC Design commenced in the lush terrain of the Santa Cruz mountains in 2009, faced with the same struggles any cultivator would face. THC Design’s largest hurdle was being ahead of their time. Prepackaged flower was not in vogue with the cannabis community, but that didn’t change a thing for THC Design. They continued to march to the beat of their own drummer, and now prepackaged flowers have become a requirement in the state of California. Since 2016, THC Design has seen significant growth, and it’s only the beginning. Their team strives to continue providing the best quality flowers on a consistent basis, while constantly evolving and reinventing their brand.
 
 
 
Process
 
THC Design cultivates premium strains of cannabis with seeds from breeders throughout the world and breeds some in-house strains as well. They offer clean flowers, free from any harsh chemicals, PGR’s (plant growth regulators), and pesticides. Not only is THC Design committed to growing healthy cannabis throughout each phase of the cultivation process, but they are also mindful of their environmental impact. They’ve committed to taking an active role in making their practices as sustainable as possible and continually integrate methods that decrease their carbon footprint.
 
 
 
Products
 
THC Design is pleased to offer medical and recreational cannabis for all walks of life. They present a wealth of knowledge proven helpful to new and lifelong cannabis consumers. Their most popular strain is XJ-13, a cross breed of Jack Herer and G13 Haze. This Sativa-dominant hybrid provides high levels of THC alongside a small percentage of CBD, making it optimal for daytime relief. A toke of XJ-13 and users experience fresh and uplifting notes of lemon, tangerine, and pine. XJ-13 is not a spaceship, but it sure will get you there.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
THC Design is dedicated to scientific advancement and identifying the roles of not only THC and CBD but also the dozens of other cannabinoids and compounds in cannabis that affect the patient. This due diligence allows them to breed better plants that can acutely address ailments, producing safer quality medicine. THC Design is pleased to offer double lab tested cannabis products, provided by SC Labs and Cannasafe.

THC Express is family owned and operated based in Kingston, WA on the northern tip of the Kitsap Peninsula. We specialize in premium small batch artisan edibles that newcomers and connoisseurs alike will enjoy. We feel quality ingredients and a delicious treat are as important as the enjoyment of the effects infused into every product. After establishing our processing center in Port Townsend in 2014 we soon learned we could not build a commercial kitchen at that location and had to pull up stakes and move to a new site in Kingston. Since we all live in the Kingston area this made the move bitter-sweet. It’s not easy building a commercial kitchen with many regulations and inspections to go through but we kept going and ended up with a clean, safe, well built processing center to work from in a community where family lives and staff can enjoy being close to home. Our hope is to build a local business that will benefit the community we live in with jobs and someday contribute part of our profit to local needy families.
 
Our Process
 
We carefully extract all of the beneficial oils from the cannabis plant in our commercial kitchen under the supervision of skilled professionals.

THCreations was founded by proud Oklahomans who aim to share their passion for chemistry, cannabis, and healing as an alternative to addiction and withdrawal inducing alternatives. Through extraction we are able to capture the cannabinoids and terpenes in their raw form free from solvents, with our choicest inventory going to our 'craft reserve' live resin cartridges. With further refinement we are able to isolate the cannabinoids and terpenes to introduce them in specific ways catering to the anecdotal evidence surrounding medical cannabis. 




Methods

Our products never come in contact with any substance not FDA approved except for the cannabis itself which is not FDA approved. Using 100% pure FDA approved grain derived ethanol at temperatures down to -120'F we are able to extract a complete portfolio of cannabinoids and terpenes without the unwanted substances such as chlorophyl(what makes the plants green), fats, waxes and any other foreign particles not associated with the effects of cannabis.

2900,"The Lady of Cannabis Caramel Dreams
 
The Caramel Lady offers what her name implies: sweet, chewy caramel squares infused with cannabis flowers. Inspired by the incredible changes that medical marijuana made in her life, The Caramel Lady has dedicated hers to the crafting of these yummy marijuana-infused caramels. For six years, she developed the reputation as the Caramel Lady, the woman with the delicious salted caramels of which no one could get enough. It was about two and a half years before the launch of her brand that her nickname “The Caramel Lady” had stuck. Everyone in the community referred to her as The Caramel Lady, and she loved it. Thus, her brand was born.
 
History
 
The Caramel Lady was delighted to launch her brand in 2017, but before that she made her rich and chewy caramels for her friends. Her passion for cannabis comes from her experience with the healing that the marijuana plant has to offer. Due to her personal health conditions, her physician prescribed medications that seemed to only make her feel worse. Once reaching a severely critical point of health, she realized she couldn’t take it anymore. After doing a tremendous amount of research on CBD, she was shocked to see the plethora of benefits cannabis had to offer. She set out to make relief possible for as many as she could, one salted caramel at a time. 
 
Products
 
The Caramel Lady crafts melt-in-your-mouth cannabis treats and delivers consistent flavor and texture in every batch. Their Salted caramels are infused with 50mg of THC and 10mg of CBD and have a consistency that patients could pull apart. The Caramel Lady also offers Caramel Corn which packs 150mg of THC per tub. Patients can curl up on the couch and medicate with this salty-sweet marijuana-infused treat. Patients should beware while medicating with The Caramel Lady, their delicious treats do not taste like cannabis at all and are difficult to stop eating.
 
Process
 
All of the Caramel Lady’s products are made with Indica flowers, offering soothing, body-focused effects. Her Salted caramels are made from cannabudder that the founder makes herself, and Caramel Corn is infused with cannabis isolate for potency. All ingredients are locally sourced, ensuring The Caramel Lady supports the community at large as well as the patients for whom she bakes her marijuana treats.
 
Lab Testing
 
The Caramel Lady lab tests all of the medical cannabis products, and publishes their results on their website. Patients will always know what is in their medicated treats, and The Caramel Lady is dedicated to full transparency with their community. They are proud to have their salted caramels and caramel popcorn lab tested through Steadfast Labs LLC. And their tests include results test for available delta 9 THC, Available CBD, THCA, activated delta 9 THC, delta 8 THC, THCV, CBDA, CBD, CBC, CBG, and CBN. The Caramel Lady also has a microbiology screen and culture testing for mold, fungi, mildew, and yeast as well as a microscopy test looking for pests and foreign material.

The Green Vault likes to think of their collective as an ever improving and ever evolving organism. The Green Vault shies away from claiming to be “the best,” and grows with new and exciting innovations in cannabis as they emerge. For their team, the work is never done, and there is always room for improvement and innovation.

Process
 
In a small town 25 minutes south of Olympia resides the state-of-the-art cannabis gardens of The Green Vault. “Don’t be lazy. Don’t be complacent,” says David, founder of The Green Vault when asked about his cultivation methods. Nothing in their grow is automated, their flowers receive care from human hands from trimming to watering. Their unique and exotic strain selection is mainly sourced from their secret stash and deliver potent and resinous yields. The Green Vault is pleased to supply Washington with premium cannabis flowers, edibles, and extractions.

19427,"High Pack Products 

What is The Higher Path’s best, everlasting deal? We’re glad you asked. Our very own house pre-rolls and bud. 




High Pack prerolls packs

 1. Infused with Diamonds 

Diamonds are one of the many forms THC-a extracts come in. They’re little crystals that quite literally look like diamonds, except you can smoke them. Diamonds are traditionally dabbed, but just like any other extract, you can add them to a pre-roll to increase your joint’s potency. 




Our pre-rolls are infused with Live-Resin Diamonds, giving you a stronger and fresher smoke. These infused pre-rolls come in a 6-pack of 0.5g each. The THC content runs at about 30%. We recommend these infused pre-rolls to anyone looking for a product higher in THC content, for an affordable price. 




2. Non-infused

 As the name implies, these pre-rolls just contain flower. They are lower in THC relative to our infused pre-rolls. We invite our patients to enjoy a calm smoke with these low-THC joints. They generally test at around 17% THC. Some of our most popular strains include Sundae Driver, Runtz and The Soap. It’s important to know that we always aim to hold a variety of strains for any house pre-rolls. We offer a choice between Sativa, Hybrid, or Indica strains. 




$6 Prerolls

 These are our most affordable pre-rolls in-house, period. At a whopping $6, you get a full gram of quality flower already rolled in a beautiful cone, ready to be lit on-the-go. These are our famous “Dollar J’s”. What are some of the many ways to get a Dollar J? 

● Come shop with any Higher Path gear. Your first time shopping with us you receive a free THP shirt. When you wear that in-shop, you automatically get a Dollar J on every purchase. We also include a dollar joint when you wear any THP merch (hat, mask, beanie). 

● Dollar Joint Friday. On Fridays, with any purchase you can get a Dollar J. 

● Write us a review! When you write us a review on Weedmaps, Leafly or even Google! Next time you come in, show us your review and we’ll get you what you worked hard for. 

● Early Bird Special. When you come between 8AM and 10AM, any day of the week, you can get a Dollar J added to your bag. 




$8 Premium Prerolls

If you’re looking for a superior house preroll, take a toke from one of our premium prerolls. Testing higher in THC at around 23%, our premium pre-rolls are for patients looking for an affordable smoke for an exclusive high. 




Higher Path Grams and 1⁄2 ounces 

If you’re one to roll your own or simply smoke out of a piece or bong, we have our house bud available in grams and half-ounces. Our 1 gram ($8) comes in full bud, whereas our 1⁄2 ounce ($55) is already ground.

Don’t forget about our Happy Hour deal from 4pm-6pm. With the purchase of any eighth, you can also get a Higher Path gram for a dollar! 




Cobra Bites 

Cobra Bites flower tests from 20-25% THC, making it ideal for smokers with a low to medium tolerance. We price our home-grown flower to make them affordable. Cobra packs bite-sized buds, which make them great for easy grinding and rolling. The terpenes vary per strain, so you can always count on feeling something different with our selection of strains. Our flower is notorious for its great taste and smooth smoke.




Cobra flower comes in several proportions. We have grams, eighths, quarters, and ounces. Our full ounces run for $99, making them the most affordable flower in the shop.




Order for curbside or in-store pickup, or delivery, and get some of the best budget buds you can find in SoCal. That's a promise.

OUR VALUES:



Cleanliness
Cleanliness is our top priority when operating our facility. You can rest assured knowing that our flower is cultivated in a manner and in a facility where cleanliness and hygiene is the top priority, every day. Our growers scrub up when they arrive to work, they change for lunch, and put on new scrubs after. We clean our facility top to bottom every single day, and we perform deep cleans within our grow rooms after each harvest before the new crop enters flower. When you purchase flower from Smokey Okies, you can rest assured that it was grown in a safe, sanitary environment.

5363,"OUR REGION
 
In the southern region of Humboldt County is an endless coastline so remote that visitors often forget they are still in California. As straight as the crow flies, our cannabis thrives in greenhouses which stand just a few miles from some of the most pristine beaches anywhere along the Pacific Ocean.
 
This is a special area of Humboldt County and we wouldn’t think to grow anywhere else. The soil is rich and the refreshing coastal air invigorates our plants and team alike.
 
DOING IT RIGHT
 
When it comes to sustainable cannabis cultivation, we are leaders in the industry. We care deeply about our environment.
 
Our 20,000+ sq ft of canopy uses the freely available and abundant light of the ultimate source, the sun. It is what these plants have been accustomed to growing under for thousands of years and, with a fully automated light deprivation system, we control the perfect amount of light required for a consistent crop each and every time.
 
Our filtered irrigation system is sourced from our rainwater reclamation ponds that fill naturally with each new rainfall.
 
This sustainable use of light and water ensures equilibrium with our surrounding world. We are the sum of it’s parts and maintaining this balance is as important as the crop we grow.
 
Working in harmony with the perfect Humboldt climate, our state of the art greenhouses maintain complete control of our growing space. This gives our plants the consistency they love and need in order to mature and bloom.
 
Being pesticide free is at the core of our values and we are proud to be so. It almost goes without saying that we would never disrupt our unique environment with the use of harmful chemicals. Instead we rely on natural systems such as predatory bugs to control pests that might damage our crop.
 
We care very deeply about our consumers and the future of our planet. In doing so we continue to take every possible step to ensure the cannabis we produce not only meets, but exceeds all sustainable cultivation standards in the industry. You may rest assured that the end result is the cleanest, smoothest cannabis on the market. Period.
 
Watch as we give you a quick overview of our facility.
 
OUR TEAM
 
Humboldt is already known as a cannabis cultivator’s paradise, attracting some of the best growers in the world. It is here that we have brought together and developed a team with a true passion for cultivating this amazing plant. Fiercely committed to growing a high quality, sustainable, clean product and with a thirst for continuous improvement in our field. We live and breathe cannabis cultivation.
 
MAKE IT SMOOTH
 
Smooth was created for the participants in life, not those who simply watch it go by. We believe in a motivated, healthy and balanced lifestyle with high quality products that compliment these principles.
 
No matter who you are though, we at Smooth understand that life is not always so. We try to help by providing something that is.",,230,56/56249eaa291af01fe24fd5d9408883dcdc0a90d4.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/005/363/avatar/original/1547078075-Smooth-Logo-Red-__1_.jpg,,Smooth,4.6304349899292,5,smooth,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/smooth,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Gem is a labor of love created by Wendy Baker in her home kitchen, in Humboldt County, CA. Space Gem was founded in 2013, after seeing a need for high quality edible products for medical patients. Wendy wanted to create a product with Humboldt grown cannabis, that was free of dyes, harsh chemicals, solvents, and fillers. We’re happy to say that in the last 7 years we’ve been successful in our efforts, and now offer some of the highest quality, solventless, award winning, handcrafted edibles on the market. The best thing about consuming cannabis though our edibles, is discrete consumption and accurate dosing. We make our products with a whole lot of love in Humboldt County and we truly hope you enjoy them.




 ""I started making edibles because I wanted to share Humboldt's quality cannabis and help people live healthier, happier lives. Now Space Gem products can be found throughout the state of California, but we're still making them in Humboldt County, where it all began, with local ice water hash.""

1674,"Space Monkey Meds cultivates flowers of an out-of-this-world quality. Growing their strains in-house with expert levels of quality control and cultivation techniques, Space Monkey Meds pays close attention to every detail to offer the best possible cannabis buds to their customers. Their experienced growing team, personal knowledge of what patients are looking for and history working in Humboldt’s Emerald Triangle propel Space Monkey Meds’ flowers to the top of the cannabis game.
 
History:
 
While they began their brand name in 2016, Space Monkey Meds carries decades of growing experience and have delivered their home-grown marijuana to Bay Area patients since 2012 and dispensing their flower to plenty of local dispensaries. Through their delivery service, the founding team cultivated an intimate understanding of what patients were looking for, while their professional conduct and high-quality cannabis kept bringing dispensaries back for more. Space Monkey Meds’ founder was among one of the first to offer their product in a can, and they slowly built up a reputation that fit their high standards of excellence. Finally positioned for takeoff, Space Monkey Meds launched their brand in 2016 to match a name to the marijuana patients and dispensaries adored, and since they’re beginnings, they’ve spread to more collectives, visited more events and are spreading their flower to touch more aspects of the cannabis industry.
 
Process:
 
Space Monkey Meds prioritizes details, understanding that close care and attention are what set their flowers apart from the crowd. Using coco, indoor growing methods and hand-trimmed attention, they’ve tended their genetics for nearly a decade to find the ideal phenotypes of each of their marijuana strains.
 
Products:
 
After their many years of growing, Space Monkey Meds is proud to offer a varied selection of cannabis flower for patients and collectives to explore. Their bestselling strain is their Grateful Breath, with genetics hailing from Gage Green Genetics. Grateful Breath’s Indica heritage stems from their best phenotype of their OGKB and offers a highly medicating, enjoyable experience.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Space Monkey Meds proudly collaborates with SC Labs to test their cannabis flowers for quality assurance. Each batch of their flowers undergoes testing for THC content and pesticides.
 
Networks:
 
Currently, Space Monkey Meds’ flowers are local to Sacramento, spreading both their cannabis and canned flowers to Sacramento delivery services as well as brick-and-mortar dispensaries in Sacramento, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Notable collectives include DTHC in Anaheim and Doctor’s Orders in Sacramento. Space Monkey Meds also partners with Paper Planes to create a line of high-quality concentrates.",,7528,55/5585fb9722a2d71bad4f884f9a2ff7861609864f.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/674/avatar/original/space-monkey-meds_logo.jpg,www.instagram.com/spacemonkeycali,Space Monkey Meds,4.509925365448,84,space-monkey-meds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/space-monkey-meds,www.spacemonkeymeds.com,,,,,,,,,,,

They strive to remain connected to the those that make their work possible and worthwhile — the cannabis community. Space Nugs invites you to experience the highest standard cannabis flowers and extracts.
 
 
 
History
 
The Space Nugs odyssey began with a group of cannabis enthusiasts working in various dispensaries throughout Southern California. As budtenders, they're well versed in a variety of cannabis products. Each longed to create something of a higher caliber, something that truly took people on a trip. They worked together to bring Space Nugs to life, officially launching in October 2016.
 
 
 
Process
 
Space Nugs ingenuity begins with premium cannabis flowers. Some flowers are separated out for extraction, where Space Nugs isolates the cannabinoids and terpenes in the plant with CO2. The extraction artists also craft kief, mechanically removing the resinous glands from their flowers to coat their creations. From there, Space Nugs’ flavorful buds are doused in CO2 oil then dipped in their specialty kief.

1162,"RESIN SEEDS FOUNDERS OF CBD MOVEMENT
 
Welcome to the official website of Resin Seeds. Thanks for taking the time to visit us. We are the founders of the CBD movement, with our CBD queen Cannatonic, which began a worldwide quest for the ultimate medicinal strains. To date, only our collaboration with CBD Crew has produced cannabis plants of equal pharmacological value. Our team takes pride in knowing that thousands of people across the globe have benefited mightily from the unique healing abilities our specially bred strains offer.
 
Back in 2008, Cannatonic was unveiled to the public, and accomplished a feat not easily imaginable at the time: winning a High Times Amsterdam Cannabis Cup in a Sativa category with a largely non-psychoactive plant. We can only suppose that the judges were so overwhelmingly impressed with the initial sensation of a balanced THC/CBD high that they had no choice but to include our Cannatonic amongst the winners.
 
Since then, we have continued developing our CBD line to include Hammershark and Dieseltonic, which again won an award in Amsterdam’s High Times Cannabis Cup, this time in 2013. And now we are proud to announce our newest addition into our CBD lineup, Kushtonic, whose lineage will soon be unveiled. Many of our other strains, the high THC strains, are also well-known world over, and recipients of extensive awards, from Chile to USA to the Balearic Islands. Our genetics are now being grown in places as atypical to the common grower as Gambia, Eslovenia, Cambodia, New Zealand and more. We can only suppose that the global debate over cannabis is reaching a tipping point, where communities are finally beginning to ignore years of backlash and brainwashing over the cannabis plant, and finally embracing the true merits it can offer.",,115,55/557af078bc238ca059db43fe737efdd2c9921c67.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/162/avatar/original/Resin-Seeds_Logo.jpg,,Resin Seeds,5,1,resin-seeds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/resin-seeds,,,,,,,,,,,,

History
 
Chief is the founder of Risen Labs, and he entered the cannabis industry in 2012. He was enthralled by the medical efficacy of the plant and the tremendous leaps of life improvement it provided for his health and those around him. When he began his journey into the industry in early 2012, the marijuana industry existed in a gray area. There was little regulation and standards for medical cannabis products, but the Chief wanted to supply products he could stand behind. In 2014, the Chief kickstarted the development of Risen Labs. He refined the brand for two years and was neck-deep in R&D, and the Chief was adamant about lab testing. He strove for complete quality control, managing multiple silos with his vertically integrated brand. In 2016, Risen Labs was ready to debut premium concentrates to the world, showcasing extractions that exceed standards and raise the bar for the cannabis community.
 
 
 
Process
 
From soil to oil, Risen Labs has a hand in each step of production. The environment in which its flowers are cultivated is determined by the needs of the strain. Risen Labs’ cannabis gardens include indoor and outdoor farms, and its growers cultivate with seeds sourced from all over the globe. Once harvested, flowers undergo an ultra-refined extraction process. Risen Labs’ extraction artists perform cannabis distillation with fracturing, and their concentrates are winterized, carbon scrubbed, and dewaxed. Then, they reintroduce cannabis-derived terpenes into the oil for a smoking experience that perfectly mirrors the original cultivar.
 
 
 
Products
 
Risen Labs' potent and flavorful cartridges and nugrun crumbles are beloved by patrons. Cartridges include cannabis distillate of incredible strains such as Fruity Pebbles, Pineapple, and Tropical Haze. No matter which cartridge you choose, Risen Labs supplies the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes for robust flavor and stellar effects.

Rochester Farms balances consistency with innovation at their state-of-the-art indoor cannabis farm. The team has experts in quality control that bring a new take to commercial growing. Rochester Farms’ stringent cultivation practices yield cannabis flowers with the utmost purity, potency, and flavor every time. Everything from the PH of the water to the humidity in the room is accounted for resulting the safest, cleanest flowers.
 
 
 
History
 
Marshall and Richard are Rochester Farms’ founders that utilized their combined expertise to create one of the most efficient cannabis farms around. They applied for cultivation licensing as soon as Washington state opened registry and began building the automated cannabis garden of their dreams. They were proud to debut their cannabis flowers to the world in January 2017 and strive to continue supplying Washington with the best nugs in the state.
 
 
 
Process
 
Mother Room
 
Rochester Farms’ automated indoor cannabis system supplies consistent nutrients to their plant's thanks to their ebb and flow system. RF’s flowers sit atop flooding and draining tables that deliver an even flow of nutrients directly to the plant's roots. The facility renders the healthiest leaves under full spectrum LED lights, providing the best lighting quality to the plants.
 
 
 
Clones
 
Rochester Farms then sends their cannabis clones from their mother plants into the flower room --a sea of green. The sea of green technique utilizes smaller plants with green stems that allow nutrients to flow more abundantly than if it were a thicker, woodier stemmed cannabis plant. Thanks to being a clone these little plants skip the vegetative state and go right into flowering robust buds.
 
 
 
Flower Room
 
Once the clones begin to blossom resinous buds, those trays of flowers are moved into the flower room with a system of tray railing. They sit under full spectrum light and are fed by the same hydroponic method as before, which allows quality control from the PH of the water to the nutrients in the tray.
 
 
 
Curing
 
Curing is predominantly done in darkness, with entire stocks of cannabis keeping trichomes perfectly intact. Then those sticky ladies are taken from their stems and sent throughout Washington for your smoking enjoyment.",,76,a6/a6a4bc59c5e66fb66c56a475649c3c959f27fae9.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/290/avatar/original/1568841282-WeedMaps_-_Rochester_Logo.png,,Rochester Farms,3.90000009536743,3,rochester-farms,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/rochester-farms,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indica cannabis for distinguished palates
 
Rooted Genetics specializes in the cultivation, purification, and extraction of Indica marijuana. Their connoisseurship is rooted into every aspect of their craft. With a flavor forward stance, Rooted Genetics leaves no stone unturned when it comes to cultivation, their state of the art grow room was built entirely by the hands of the founding team. Thanks to Rooted Genetics commitment to the time and energy required to cultivate and extract shatter and flowers with a distinguished palate.
 
History: The founding team of Rooted Genetics is pleased to lend their years of expertise to the craft of extraction and marijuana farming. With over ten years within the cannabis industry, they are excited to become rooted in cannabis brands for their concentrate and flowers. Rooted Genetics stemmed from one of the founding member’s need to sleep and when he found aid, among other fun euphoria, in medicating with cannabis for his insomnia. Being taken by the body-based effects of Indica cannabis, the original founders were inspired to launch a brand that hones in the blissful relaxation of the strain.
 
Process: Rooted Genetics focuses on raising and curing Indica flowers, and their master extractors develops pure, high quality shatter. Their five star grow room wastes no light, and their cultivators know the ins and outs of raising flowers. Everything inside the grow room is custom, hand-made by Rooted Genetics founders and cultivators. Their flowers and concentrates come from fully flushed, slow cured Indica marijuana. Rooted Genetics stands out in their process, the founders spend extra time with their flowers, creating a robust flavor and effect that is not replicable.
 
Products: Purveyors of the highest quality Indica flowers and extracts, Rooted Genetics offers full bodied, flavor and aroma in each of their products. Whether enjoying one of their fresh and flavorful Indica flowers or dabbing a glob of their purely extracted, delicious shatters, the purity, taste, and potency are always on cue. The rich flavor and clean effects stem from the years of time with the cannabis cultivation secrets the cannabis plant has to offer. Rooted Genetics is flavor forward, taking meticulous strides toward preserving and maximizing the original flavor and aroma. Rooted Genetics has a couple of heavy hitters, including Liquid Butter and Art OG. They also balance their menu with a lovely Lavender OG, which boasts a sweet and herbal flavor profile with focusing and relaxing effects.
 
Networks: Rooted Genetics is proud to be part of the medical marijuana community and strives to provide connoisseurship in each of their cannabis products.

“Reimagining cannabis from an evolving, regenerative perspective.”

 

We distinguish ourselves through an ingredient-driven approach, the exclusive use of flower rosin, and our collaborations with celebrated chefs and farmers. Instead of masking the plant’s flavor, we find beauty in it, exploring alluring ways to incorporate into each recipe seasonal fruit that’s sourced from some of California’s most respected farmers. Through the development of our own 10-acre polyculture farm located in the Sierra Foothills, Rose is working to offer the first-ever closed loop edibles on the market. 

 

DELIGHTS which take their name from the traditional Turkish confections, are the first edibles on the recreational market to be infused with single-strain, whole-flower rosin that’s pressed in-house, which preserves the natural qualities of the plant and delivers a deeply satisfying experience.

 

SINGLES like Delights, Singles are infused with flower rosin. At 1 MG per dose, they offer more flexible dosing.

 

ROSE FLOWER honors Rose’s long-standing relationships with its legacy growers and showcases the output of the company’s Penn Valley farm.

Rove built the foundation of their company on honesty, simplicity, and transparency. Their mission is to provide customers with great tasting vape cartridges and reliable and dependable vape pens. Rove proudly stands opposed to the trend of exaggerated quality and misinformation within product test results. Rove wants their customers to know they have their best interests in mind with every single step they take. They strive for excellence and are dedicated to improvement.

Welcome to Rove, where the best is always getting better.

 

History:

The enthusiasts behind Rove noticed the cannabis industry’s growing interest in vape pens and cartridges. Already established in various arenas within the marijuana industry, they looked amongst their peers and individually came to the same conclusion: “we could do a lot better with more transparency.” In 2015, they quickly banded together to combine their wealth of cultivation, extraction, and laboratory experience to create Rove. Their tremendous growth started on day one. Initially working with a small number of outlets, their products were met with an uncommon enthusiasm. Each week saw Rove opening new dispensary relationships with more and more demand for their products. Today, Rove products can be found in over 250 shops and deliveries throughout California, Nevada, Arizona, and Oklahoma. 

 

Process:

Rove takes great pride in using a true solventless CO2 extraction method. While many other manufacturers boast about using a refined CO2 process, they still end up using solvents after the extraction process. Rove doesn’t. Rove’s CO2 extracts using liquid carbon dioxide which they then refine utilizing only heat and pressure. Although this process can be painstakingly time-consuming, the end result of producing a thinner and cleaner oil for their patients is more than worth the effort.

 

Products:

Rove is renowned for their simple, tasty, and dependable vape cartridges. Portable and discreet, the aim of their cartridges is to provide ultimate convenience no matter where you are or what you’re doing. Each oil is mixed with natural terpenes to provide authentic and pure flavors with each inhale and exhale. Believing that dependability is the fundamental cornerstone with vapes, Rove uses a high-quality stainless steel and pyrex cartridge equipped with a sure-fire dual coil atomizer. 

 

Lab Testing:

Rove proudly tests their products with Bel Costa Labs. They test for all cannabinoid potency, ensuring the levels of THC and CBD in each cartridge. They don’t test for solvents, because…well….they don’t use any.

 

Networks:

Since entering the cannabis scene in 2015, Rove has continued to grow exponentially, collaborating and building relationships with like-minded cannabis devotees. Each of their products is made using 100% California grown cannabis, working closely with growers and farm collectives. Their products can be found throughout all of California, including South Coast Safe Access, Orange County Cannabis Club, Downtown Patient Collective, and Green Tree Remedy.

1856,"Royal Queen Seeds is amongst the top rapidly-growing cannabis seeds breeders in Europe, and hopes to become worldwide market leader within a few years. After years of experience in growing cannabis seeds in the Netherlands, we’ve decided to launch a new line of seeds on the market, called Royal Queen Seeds.
 
Royal Queen Seeds is able to provide quality feminized, autoflowering and medical seeds at a good price. This new product line certainly didn’t come up by chance, but is the fruit of more than 20 years’ experience in the growing business. Our seeds have won many prizes over the years, including the well-known Highlife Cup and the High Times Cannabis Cup. We decided it was time to share our competence in cannabis seed growing with beginners and experts alike.
 

Here are some advantages of RQS seeds:
 
- All seeds are tested in detail to guarantee their genetic purity.
- All cannabis seeds are hand-picked.
- We only keep powerful qualities like Haze or white species.
- All seeds come directly from organic mothers.
- Our seeds are tested daily to guarantee their “germinating strength”.
- Our cannabis seeds are vacuum packed. 
- The seeds are packaged in highly-resistant packages.
 
We always do our best to obtain an excellent final result. We can offer you a good yield, a pleasant flavour and a great species elaboration method. Of course, the final result also depends on the grower’s experience and the methods he uses.
If you need any further explanations or have any comments, you can reach us by telephone or email. The Royal Queen Seeds team is at your disposal.
Very best wishes,

4256,"We are happy and proud to introduce you to the first wines in the world with cannabis terpene extracts: Rozoy-Picot wines.
 
These wines are the result of extensive research carried out in some of the leading French laboratories that certified them in accordance with current regulations. This results in an exceptional product with unique character, combining wine and terpenes- natural and 100% legal extracts of cannabis -, that preserve the aromas and flavors of the various plants selected.
 
Terpenes, natural hydrocarbons that can be found in thousands of plants around the world, are extracted in the form of essential oils due to their medicinal properties. We use 100% organic terpenes that do not contain any traces of cannabinoids and have proven therapeutic virtues, notably organoleptic.
 
Terpenes have infinite potential uses, but our company has intentionally sought to focus on a recreational and festive use.
 
The unique taste of our wines resides in the production concept which associates our cannabis terpenes during the winemaking process.Our wines are free of any traces of cannabinoid; which enables the aromas and flavors of the various plants selected to blend with each other perfectly.
 
Rozoy-Picot is focused on preserving the French know-how, where luxury products are combined with festive and relaxing moments to offer a unique pallet of tastes. The ancestral heritage of winemaking, combined with our cutting-edge approach, will seduce demanding consumers, in constant search of new tastes and pleasures. In this context, we are developing and will commercialize in the near future, as a world premiere, our own wine integrating our cannabis terpenes.",,12,bb/bbcdc9d2675e41ed3caa3d23b4f5a8786d5abc5f.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/004/256/avatar/original/1522102251-Rozoy_Picot.png,,Rozoy Picot,0,0,rozoy-picot,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/rozoy-picot,,,,,,,,,,,,

3741,"Samsara Seeds was conceived as a seed bank that seeks to offer its customers not only cannabis seeds, but also a lifestyle choice and an understanding of cannabis.
 
We are continually adapting to changing circumstances in search of new experiences to offer growers of our seeds.
 
We believe that there should be a balance between the seeds we offer our customers and their needs. This is our philosophy, our attitude to life and it is entirely valid and useful to face the challenges we meet every day. Our strains are developed according to these concepts of balance and harmony.
 
Every single one of the strains you will find in our catalog has been designed and developed very carefully, focusing our energy and commitment to our customers into offering quality, originality and medicinal varieties.
 
We created a range of plants with the intention of differentiating ourselves from the rest of seed banks. We selected the parents by crossing some of our best mother plants provided that these met our customers’ organoleptic and medicinal criteria as well as current market needs.
 
To achieve this, we spent a long time listening to and taking note of the interests, tastes and interests of cannabis lovers around the world. It is for this reason that you will find crosses in our catalog that would be very difficult to find in other banks’. There are also strains that ooze with the balance and natural harmony of this sacred plant which humans have been cultivating for more than ten thousand years.
 
 The cannabis plant is inextricably linked to the concept of “medicine”. We know that one of the main reasons the cannabis plant exists is for us to use it for our own benefit, exploiting its many palliative and curative applications. It can be used efficiently and safely with any other medication.
 
Cannabis’s medicinal value is, therefore, the aspect that interests, motivates and worries us most when developing our strains. We were especially careful to select those varieties which provide the highest possible medicinal value to our plants whether these be mainly Indica or Sativa dominant. 
 
The curative value of CANNABIS and its derivatives has been proven and is accepted to treat a broad range of different ailments",,43,40/40690ec5e10d05c851cc9c8a0012ebc159f25122.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/741/avatar/original/1554282811-logo_samsara.jpg,,SamSara Seeds,4.5,0,samsara-seeds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/samsara-seeds,https://www.samsaraseeds.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

2144,"Our mission at the SC Veterans Alliance is to provide Qualified California Military Veterans with top quality, lab-tested medical cannabis grown by fellow United States Military Veterans. The cornerstone of SCVA is our Veteran Compassion Program (VCP). Through the VCP every member of this collective receives FREE, top quality, lab-tested medical cannabis. It’s our way of honoring fellow veterans and assisting combat veterans who have service-related disabilities. This program allows our members to collectively have a voice in our organization and the cannabis movement.
 
SCVA strives to be a community for veterans and supporters to reach out to one another. We want to create a place for veterans to speak about their combat experiences and the therapeutic benefits of medical cannabis, specifically as it relates to the traumas of war. We promote the medicinal benefits of cannabis and how to better address issues of pharmaceutical dependence, depression, anxiety, anger, and other ailments. The SCVA team also hopes to bring awareness to the issue of veteran suicide, which occurs at a staggering rate of at least 22 a day. There is a veteran health epidemic going on in this country and we believe we have a powerful tool in fighting for veteran care. We do our part to reduce this heart breaking number through the healing power of medical cannabis, horticultural therapy and camaraderie.
 
The SCVA team believes that as military veterans we can take charge and lead the way when it comes to growing and providing this medicine. We strive to incorporate the skills and disciplines learned in the military to create a collective model based on pride, integrity, commitment, attention to detail, and service to others. The majority of our members do not have the means to grow their own medical cannabis or the finances to purchase it from a dispensary, therefore we collectively cultivate. By doing so we are able to provide free medicine to those members that need it the most.
 
Our members are United States Military Veterans that are mostly low income, and/or disabled, and the majority have seen combat either in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. We have members that hold disability ratings from the VA for health issues including amputations to Post Traumatic Stress, Traumatic Brain Injury, Crohn’s disease, and chronic pain. We have even unfortunately seen one of our veterans pass away from cancer. However, as a community we try and pull each other up through camaraderie, community, friendship, and compassion.
 
We not only cultivate for clean consistent medical grade cannabis, we also practice horticultural therapy. The calming influence of a plant-rich environment has been transformed into a therapeutic tool. Horticulture Therapy was historically used with servicemen returning from World War I and II as an opportunity for healing, stress reduction, exercise, and learning. Bringing a veteran into the cannabis garden teaches them a new skill, gives them community, allows them to know their medicine, and provides a peaceful environment. We believe through gardening that we are Cultivating Mindfulness by increasing observational skills, attention span, and fostering small moments of peace. Our veterans improve their strength, coordination and range of motion while working in the garden and for those who are not physically able to garden, even being amongst the group and plants provide a safe social space to interact, cooperate, and even be inspired by others with similar disabilities. This is what inspires our work, our beliefs, and our collective motto of Peace Through Cultivation.
 
SCVA complies with California medical cannabis law pursuant to H&S11362 (Proposition 215) and SB420

4505,"Es ist uns wichtig mit naturreinen Zutaten zu arbeiten. Hautpflege kann ganz natürlich sein und wir verzichten bewusst auf Konservierungsstoffe, da wir noch kein zugelassenes Konservierungsmittel gefunden haben, das nicht im Verdacht steht karzinogen zu sein.
 
Viele der in modernen Kosmetica verwendeten Chemikalien sind hochgiftig, werden an Tieren getestet, während die Verträglichkeit am Menschen oftmals, quasi im großen Feldversuch, getestet werden. Die Nebenwirkungen sind vielfältig, als auch oft verheerend, wie auch die schnell wachsende Anzahl an Allergikern nahelegt.
 
Wir werden immer wieder auf die „wahrscheinlich” heilende Wirkung unserer Produkte angesprochen. Als „Sativacare“ werden und dürfen wir euch unsere Produkte allerdings nur als Kosmetik und Pflege anbieten. Dennoch möchte euch ein Team-Mitglied seine Erfahrungen, ganz unabhängig von „Sativacare”, schildern:
 
“Hanf ist eine Pflanze mit vielen nützlichen Eigenschaften. Ich persönlich setze auf die hautpflegenden Aspekte in den Kosmetikprodukten von Sativacare. Hanf ist beispielsweise für die Linderung von Schmerzen, Übelkeit und Muskelverspannungen bekannt. Darüber hinaus ist der hautstraffende Effekt ein absoluter Bonuspunkt, der das gesamte Bild perfekt abrundet.
 
Ich selbst bin Schmerzpatient und habe seit meiner Jugend Muskelverspannungen. Zudem leide ich, nach vier Bandscheibenvorfällen, an einer chronischen Ischialgie. Außerdem wurden bei mir ausgeprägtes ADHS, Schlafstörungen und Depressionen diagnostiziert. Um Linderung zu erhalten und meinen Alltag zu erleichtern, habe ich mich viele Jahre selbst mit Cannabis behandelt, welches mir auf der Straße verkauft worden ist. Ob ich jedoch Linderung erhielt, hing immer von der gerade verfügbaren Sorte ab. So half mir Cannabis oft sehr gut und manchmal überhaupt nicht.
 
Mittlerweile habe ich ein Rezept für „Sativex“ – ein sehr teures Fertigarzneimittel, das auf Cannabis basiert und nicht von der Krankenkasse übernommen wird. Seit mir genügend Cannabidiol (CBD) zur Verfügung steht, rauche ich viermal weniger (THC) als zuvor. Denn meine Muskelverspannungen und Schlafstörungen haben komplett nachgelassen! Wenn ich diese Option bereits vor zehn Jahren gehabt hätte, wären mir einige Jahre in der „Pharma-Hölle“ erspart geblieben.
 
Ich musste über zwei Jahre hinweg starke Opiate einnehmen, was nicht gerade förderlich gegenüber meiner starken Medikamentenunverträglichkeit war. Mit der Hilfe von Hanf konnte ich diese, für mich schädlichen Wirkstoffe ganzheitlich und ohne Probleme absetzen!
 
Selbstverständlich weiß ich, dass THC ebenfalls ein wichtiger Bestandteil des heiligen Krautes ist. Zur zeit dürfen wir jedoch nur weniger als 0,2 % THC verkaufen. Dies hat jedoch auch den Vorteil, dass unsere Produkte nicht berauschend wirken. Das enthaltene CBD wirkt sogar beruhigend und ist in unseren Produkten garantiert in ausreichender Potenz beigefügt.
Bei Cannabis, das man auf der Straße kaufen kann, wäre das nicht garantiert – ganz zu schweigen von den gefährlichen Streckmitteln, die oft hinzugefügt werden.
 
Cannabinoide werden übrigens vollständig über die Haut aufgenommen und können so auch kosmetisch voll zum Einsatz kommen.”
 
_
 
“Cannabisprodukte üben eine Vielzahl von Wirkungen aus. Sie können daher nicht selten mehrere Symptome einer Erkrankung lindern.”
 
– Dr. Med. Franjo Grotenhermen

The owner takes the time to learn the opinions and preferences of their customers, and take patient needs into consideration through everything they do. Savage Woods is proud to present their line of flowers and shatter rolled with care into the perfect blunt.
 
 
 
History
 
The founder of Savage Woods has over ten years of experience in the marijuana industry, and earned his start at a collective in Long Beach, California. His father was part of the cannabis industry, and the founder was connected serendipitously. One day while at a dispensary, his dad told him, “If you see the owner, ask him for a job.” He took his father’s advice and left the shop as a budtender. He has been plugged into the industry ever since, marijuana paving a way towards his niche. The marijuana industry took him all over the state, and with his travels he absorbed the knowledge and skills of cannabis cultivation. After acquiring skills in over two dozen dispensaries, he started his own and began selling the early phases of Savage Woods. Unlabeled, and without shatter, Savage Woods prerolls made waves in his shop and among friends. As time passed, his product developed, and Savage Woods was born. Today, Savage Woods is proud to grace shop menus everywhere with their premium flowers and shatter, rolled into a Backwoods blunt.
 
 
 
Process
 
Savage Woods’ diverse menu is crafted from two factors, wraps and strains. Savage Woods offers three types of prerolls in Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid strains. Their blunts are rolled by hand, ensuring the utmost quality and attention to detail. Savage Woods work with OG Kush, King Louis, Paris OG, and Gorilla Glue strains and several Backwoods flavors to craft their blunts. Their rollers start one Backwoods flavor at a time and move through box by box, flavor by flavor, rolling each Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid blend into a different flavored Backwoods blunt.
 
 
 
Products
 
By the way, SavageWoods take the whole container.
 
 
 
They offer their high-quality prerolls in savage portions, pop open the joint container to reveal a thick blunt, densely packed into a Backwoods wrap. Toke mindfully, these bad boys are potent, packing resinous flowers and potent shatter in every blunt. SavageWood Hybrid exhibits the best of both worlds, presenting a blend of top-notch hybrid flowers with evenly balanced effects. Their SavageWood Indica is a body-heavy, relaxing blunt, ideal to spark-up after a long day. Light up the night with SavageWood Sativa, an energizing and invigorating blend of Sativa marijuana with cerebral effects.

Africa is home to the finest examples of Cannabis Sativa on the planet and our intention is to pass on these pure “foundation strains” to the rest of humanity so as not to lose them forever in a world dominated by hybridised/feminized cannabis varieties. Today’s Cannabis has been modified to the extent that many have lost their original mystic and power, giving way to the unnatural demands of today’s grower. These modern day strains get nowhere near the purity and clarity of their ancestral family as all of the original “power phenos”are lost within the process of cross breeding and feminising.
 
We are not breeders, we consider ourselves preservationists, and along with passing on these genetics, we also want to share an understanding of where these wild landrace Sativa’s grow by detailing the conditions of the area that they are collected. This will give you a higher understanding of each strain and hopefully bring you closer to the plant itself. We hope that the rare phenotypes in each strain will be selected, collected and protected, claiming back the legendary Sativa strains of ancient Africa and the beauty, power and purity that are within them.

The story of Select started with a cough, which led to a thought, which led to a better cartridge. Since day one our focus has been on product safety, and we’ve risen above because of our commitment to setting standards around pesticide, hardware, andoil testing.




Safety




Select tests to the highest standards for potency and pesticides in every state we're in. In fact, our internal standards are more stringent than state compliance requirements.




Sourcing




Our partnership with farmers is built with intent, integrity, and transparency.

We never add harmful cutting agents such as vegetable glycerine (VG), propylene glycol (PG) or Vitamin E Acetate to our cartridges.




Consistency




Each cartridge is hand-filled to ensure quality, followed by further inspection through four quality control stations.

Ensuring a full flavor and smooth feel without fail. Every time.




Innovation




Our story started when our founder identified a cleaner, safer option for vaporizer pen technology.

From there, we've worked to innovate and set standards around testing, company culture, brand, and more.




Commitment




We are constantly innovating for the future of the industry.

All for a better cannabis experience.

And we promise to never stop getting better.

2246,"SENSI SEEDS PIONEERED THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO BECOME THE WORLD’S LARGEST SEED BANK PIONEERS OF THE CANNABIS SEED INDUSTRY

Sensi Seeds pioneered the cannabis seed industry in 1985. Today, the company is the world’s largest cannabis seedbank with over 500 varieties. These genetics and the brand name have become true classics in the cannabis community. The Dutch government chose Sensi Seeds genetics to develop the medicinal cannabis supplied by pharmacies.

Sensi Seeds aims for the normalization of cannabis use and recognition of the plant’s therapeutic and industrial benefits. This led the company to open the world’s first cannabis museum in 1985. The Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum is now present in both Amsterdam and Barcelona and has welcomed over two million visitors.

Together with the museum, Sensi Seeds regularly hosts the Cannabis Culture Awards. This award celebrates those who have taken a stand for the acceptance of cannabis. Winners include Sir Richard Branson, and former Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dries van Agt.

Sensi Seeds opened its sister-company, HempFlax in 1993. The company developed new processing methods and purpose-built equipment for hemp cultivation. These innovations have since become the industry standard. They are now used by leading agricultural and construction equipment manufacturers, including John Deere.

HempFlax products are widely used in the textile, food, construction and body-care industries. The automotive industry has also adopted hemp, including brands like BMW, Mercedes and Bentley. Hemp is making a successful come-back and HempFlax is leading the way.

The world’s attitude towards cannabis is changing. Countries are now legalising cannabis for medicinal and recreational use. The possibilities for industrial, nutritional and pharmaceutical applications of hemp continue to surprise us. Sensi Seeds will play its part and remain at the forefront of these developments.

Sensi seeds strives for the acceptance of cannabis worldwide and believes that responsible consumption of cannabis can enrich one’s life.

With more than 30 years’ worth of experience in the field of cannabis, Sensi Seeds is fully aware of the crucial role that cannabis can play for humankind. The company is pleased to see the current increase in attention and recognition for the plant worldwide, not only as a medicine but also as a raw material.

Sensi Seeds is committed to preserving the genetic diversity and accessibility of the cannabis plant for future generations, and disseminating information and knowledge about the beneficial effects the plant can have when used appropriately.",SensiSeedBank,804,23/23d882bd6d0eed07f61dc684bc030657f295cf53.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/246/avatar/original/sensi-seeds_logo.jpg,official.sensiseeds,Sensi Seeds,4.22222232818604,2,sensi-seeds,SENSISEEDBANK,https://weedmaps.com/brands/sensi-seeds,https://sensiseeds.com/,,,,,,,,,,,

3052,"PharmaHemp is a trusted producer and supplier of superior cannabidiol (CBD).
 
Passionate about unspoiled nature and innovative technology, we strive to bring the purest, CBD-rich products onto the health market. As a family-owned company, we engage in every part of the process – from choosing the right soil for our crops to the most effective extraction methods and prompt distribution. This enables us to provide our clients with a complete service and a trustworthy, consistent product of the finest quality. We are proud that independent, third-party testing confirms the excellence of PharmaHemp.
 
 
 
PharmaHemp is a pioneering European grower of organic hemp.
 
We make no compromises when it comes to quality. This begins by selecting local, European-certified seeds. Because we have plenty of experience, we can choose the perfect strain for certain formulations with the proper CBD percentage and cannabinoid ratio. We then place the precious seeds into carefully selected, fertile soil. For this task, we revived some traditional European hemp-growing farms in Slovenia and Croatia. Our environmental awareness and natural resources give us an advantage in producing all-natural raw hemp free of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and heavy metals.
 
 
 
PharmaHemp is meticulous in ensuring the maximum levels of essential fats, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial elements are preserved in every step of the process.
 
To achieve this, we harvest our hemp only on specially selected days. Like in the past, all our crops are harvested by hand. Each flower is separated from the stalk by hand, which also means we can make a selection and pick only premium flowers. To safeguard the potency of our hemp, we let it dry naturally, always at temperatures below 35° C. A special closed-machine method helps us secure the precious crystals on the flowers, so-called trichomes, where the cannabinoids and terpenes accumulate. The dried material is then pressed into pellets that contain a special PharmaHemp blend of three authentic European hemp varieties, rich in active cannabinoids.",,53,cd/cd11cd512fca4eef87c9ce15a718bb2af5e18648.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/003/052/avatar/original/1504903131-pharma-hemplogo.jpg,,PharmaHemp,0,0,pharmahemp,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/pharmahemp,,,,,,,,,,,,

History

Patient Founded.

The founders of PLUGplay were profoundly shaped by the benefits of medicinal cannabis. They have been part of the industry for over a decade. One took root in cultivation and flower vending, eventually moving into dispensary management; while the other was immersed in the art of cannabis extractions. PLUGplay’sextraction artist/co-founder mastered everything from Butane and Propane hash oil extractions to Live Resin and Rosin concentrates.

“Our fondest memories have always surrounded cannabis.”

Both founders were moved by their collection of memories and positive experiences surrounding marijuana. They realized that the plant brings people together while possessing the capacity to heal. They wanted to create an easy, and non-intimidating way to introduce cannabis to those who are new to the herb. The founders knew that vape oils were the best means to introduce cannabis to a community in need of a natural alternative medicine and got to work creating a cannabrand that could reach anyone.

Each founder brought their own area of expertise in cultivation and extraction to Plugplay. Although they were eager to plug in, the founders took their time creating their products and spent two years in research and development. Supplying potent, resinous, and clean flowers then extracting them into high-quality distillate was a breeze -- the founders already knew how to do that. It was crafting a setup that met the dynamic needs of today’s cannabis consumer that needed work. For a year and a half, the two ran product tests and through trial and error found the ideal instrument for cannabis vapes. They were overjoyed to launch PLUGplay in July 2017. Today, the PLUGplayteam continually strives to provide excellent, reliable cannabis oils and batteries while remaining committed to openness and approachability.



Process

Crafting Approachability

Cannabis oils are only as good as their starting material, which is why PLUGplay partners with cannabis farms that meet high standards in their grow. Only greenhouse-grown buds from a pesticide-free environment are allowed for processing. PLUGplay founders have taken it upon themselves to be on-par with the cannabis processing standards in the state of Oregon. PLUGplayco-founder/extraction artist then separates the trichomes through shorthand distillation, resulting in solvent-free, potent oil.



Products

Let’s Play

Play vape batteries deliver a unique mechanism for cannabis vapor. Their sleek design offers more than an aesthetically pleasing battery, it also delivers in every aspect of convenience. Their flat design makes it easy to slip into pockets or bags and prevents it from rolling off surfaces. Another perk to its flat and matte black design is discretion -- Play can easily pass for a USB stick. The square button at the center of Play takes five-clicks to power on and off, preventing it from vaporizing from accidental button clicks. Each Play battery comes with a USB charger and encased in a sleek, stylish PLUGplaybox.

Plug in

Plug cartridges provide a glimpse into modern cannabis vapes. Their two lines include DNA and Exotic, each meeting the needs of the diverse cannabis community. Plug’s DNA cartridge reintroduces cannabis-derived terpenes into the distillate for a full-bodied smoke experience that feels and tastes like the original strain. DNA is offered in PLUGplay's nighttime cartridge Fire OG, King Louie XIII, daytime Train Wreck, Jack Herer and anytime Pineapple Express, Girl Scouts Cookies. For the flavor driven 710 crowd, Plug’s Exotic line comes in Strawberry Champagne, Apple Slushie, Pound Cake, Grape Ape Soda, and Pineapple Cooler.



Lab Testing

PLUGplay holds the safety and compliance of their products to the highest regard and their team proudly lab tests their cannabis oils through Cannalysis. Their distillate oils are tested for pesticides, residual solvents, and potency.",,58243,41/414a05089c8e59ba496ba72208b7e39daff70f31.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/735/avatar/original/1527890203-plugandplay_logo_v2.png,,PLUGplay,4.51002264022827,538,plugplay,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/plugplay,,,,,,,,,,,,

Populum's core products utilize high quality cannabinoid CBD, or Cannabidiol, extracted from hemp plants to create an all-natural solution for life’s everyday wellbeing. When it comes to utilizing a CBD product for the first time, often people do not know where to start or what to use. Populum aims to clear the confusion and dispel misunderstanding. Their goal is to educate the public about hemp oil and make it easy for customers to find what works best for them.

History
 
In early 2016, Gunhee and Ola saw an opportunity to increase quality and transparency in the hemp CBD industry. The two set out to build a brand that offers a transparent product while providing a great customer experience. They came up with Populum, a company that reimagined how people understand and access CBD-products. By the end of that same year, Populum launched, revealing their Signature 500 tincture oil in a delicious orange flavor.
 
 
 
As Populum continued to grow, Gunhee and Ola pressed in and expanded their product portfolio. They introduced perks that made trying their products easier and less expensive, first with a risk-free trial, then with a referral program. Feedback is important to the founders, so they worked with review sites and bloggers to solicit the voice of their customers. Populum had an overwhelming response; people loved the hemp oil products and the accountability behind the brand. Today, Populum continues their hemp advocacy and strives to innovate and produce more hemp products that elevate the quality of life.
 
 
 
Process
 
Every Populum product begins as a hemp plant cultivated on Colorado farms. Once ready, those plants are carefully harvested by Colorado growers and cured to perfection. That’s when Populum steps in. They take their sourced material and isolate the full-spectrum hemp extracts and terpenes locked inside the plant. Once the helpful properties from the hemp flowers are extracted, the hemp-oil is infused into each of their products. The result is clean and potent products that provide powerful relief without any impact on cognitive function.
 
 
 
Products

POSH proudly supplies a higher standard of cannabis flowers, with a strain selection that caters to every Californian in the cannabis community. POSH created a new standard for cannabis --their collective provides access for quality medication with lab tested flowers that peak in the 30% THC range and never drop below 20%. When you take a toke of POSH flowers, you experience over three decades of cannabis farming coming together to create potent, flavorful buds. POSH draws inspiration from the many lives that have improved through effective cannabis treatments and strives to be the source of premium cannabis flowers in Southern California and beyond.
 
 
 
History 
 
The founder experienced the relief that cannabis can provide in his early youth when his father handed him a joint after suffering a broken tooth. Later in his life, he took an interest in growing and went to check out a cannabis farm his friend was operating in the Central Valley. He moved in and began to learn the ropes of cannabis cultivation. Once gaining a substantial amount of knowledge and experience with the plant, he was ready to start a farm of his own and took root in Fullerton, California.
 
 
 
He became a vendor for his friend’s successful cannabis delivery service based in Orange County. His interest in deliveries were peaked, and his cannabis delivery buddy was all too happy to show him the template to run that kind of cannabusiness--Proving you truly do get by and get high with a little help from your friends.
 
 
 
The founder then launched TriComb Therapies Delivery Service in Victorville, California, which still serves the 420 community today. POSH is the founder’s latest feat in his passion for cannabis. Founded in 2016, he wanted to put a name to the amazing flowers that have been regaling Southern California patients for many years. Today, POSH gladly continues to serve the medical cannabis community, providing premium, California grown and raised flowers.
 
 
 
Process
 
A combination of lots of time and organic processes are what make POSH's cannabis a step above the average flowers. POSH brews a large amount of teas, and depending on what stage their plants are in will mix tea into the soil. They utilize high porosity soil so that their cannabis is fed as though in a hydroponic system with stellar ebb and flow. With the perfect amount of saturation of water and nutrients, and individualized attention to each cultivar, POSH’s cannabis cultivation yields potent and great tasting buds.
 
 
 
Products
 
POSH cultivates approximately 20 different strains of cannabis, cultivated to accentuate each strains amazing healing properties, effects, and flavors. Two of their OG’s have caught the spotlight for many patrons of POSH. First being Divine OG, an Indica flower with heavenly effects and flavor. Equally loved is Abusive OG, an opposite to their other OG favorite, Abusive OG is a pure Indica and delivers lulling euphoria and a sweet, herbal flavor profile. Good old Gorilla Glue #4 is another patient favorite, whose resinous buds exhibit intense pine and earthy terpenes. For a citrusy sweet Hybrid take home POSH’s Orange Creamsicle flowers which provide euphoria, relaxation, and a boost in mood.

912,"Los orígenes de Positronics se remontan a los años 60, en los que nuestro fundador, Wernard Bruining, se instala definitivamente en Ámsterdam y comienza sus estudios para ser profesor. En esta emblemática ciudad descubre que su verdadera pasión era y sigue siendo el cannabis.
 
A principios de los 70 se une la comuna “Second Home”, inundada por el ambiente hippie de la época, en la que compartían incluso el “hash” que negociaban directamente con los escasos contactos de la época. El desalojo de este “segundo hogar” fue el origen del “Mellow Yellow”, el primero de los famosos “Coffee Shop” holandeses, una antigua panadería transformada en tetería con una revolucionaria novedad: podías comprar “hash” en bolsitas ya preparadas y fumar mientras te tomabas algo con los amigos. Una propuesta innovadora que se extendió rápidamente, y aunque lamentablemente el “Mellow Yellow” se quemó a finales de esta década, su modelo ha llegado a ser una seña de identidad por la que se conoce a Holanda internacionalmente.
 
Wernard imbatible por el fuego decide viajar a finales de los 70 a Estados Unidos para seguir investigando sobre la planta. Allí descubre la “Sinsemilla”, una marihuana de primera clase, que al proceder de una planta no fecundada produce más THC, y otras sustancias psicoactivas, en sus flores. Y lo más importante, tiene la gran suerte de conocer en California al experimentado productor de cannabis, “Old” Ed Holloway, padre del conocido Ed Rosentahl, con quien regresa a Ámsterdam cargado de una selecta colección de semillas. El objetivo, transformar Holanda en la Jamaica de Europa, comenzando por enseñar a un escogido equipo el cultivo de Sinsemilla de manera orgánica. Y una vez más vuelve a innovar dando origen a principios de los 80 al denominado “cultivo de guerrilla”. Los aprendices pasaban a ser cultivadores bajo las expertas direcciones de Wernard y Ed para abastecer los “Coffee Shop” y se repartían las ganancias.
 
Es en 1985 cuando Wernard se decide a dar el gran paso y crea Positronics Seeds, el primer banco de semillas europeo. El nombre surge de la combinación de las palabras “Positive Electronics”, electrónica positiva, de la combinación del uso de la electricidad y la tecnología con la naturaleza para conseguir energía positiva y sanadora.
 
En los años siguientes diseña su propia lámpara de cultivo para la producción interior, introduce los esquejes para que todo el mundo pudiera cultivar la misma variedad y publica con su equipo el primer periódico de cannabis de Holanda: Soft Secret, un periódico que se distribuye hoy día gratuitamente en los grow y en las asociaciones de toda Europa y algunos países de América Latina.
 
Wernard también crea el sistema sin ánimo de lucro Mediwiet, compuesto por “Coffee Shop” y “Grow Shop”, con el objetivo de suministrar cannabis a un 50% del precio real a enfermos que se beneficiaban con el uso de la planta. Además de continuar con su promoción de los “Coffee Shop” como fenómeno social, da cursos y seminarios como reconocida figura del mundo cannábico, centrándose en sus aplicaciones médicas.
 
Tras dos intensas décadas, en 2004 Positronics renace con el encuentro de Wernard y Sebas, apasionado también de la plantas y con un “Grow Shop” desde hace más de 15 años en Málaga, España. Juntos deciden compartir las genéticas de ambos, aplicando sus conocimientos, experiencia y testando los mejores cruces lanzan tres variedades regulares: “Old Ed, el Viejo Ed” en honor a “Old” Ed Holloway, “Cristal Misty” y “Double Fun”.
 
En 2008 el equipo de Positronics Seeds, ampliado con las incorporaciones de Zurdo y Mintxo, presenta 7 nuevas genéticas ya de variedades feminizadas:
 
4 ÍNDICAS : Critical#47, Caramelice, Blue Rhino, Black Widow.
 
3 SATIVAS : Claustrum, Purple Haze, Jack Diesel.
 
A lo largo de los años han seguido ampliando el catálogo sin perder su objetivo principal: investigar a fondo la planta y desarrollar nuevas variedades para todos los paladares y sentidos. Genética autoflorecientes, como la Afghan Express y las versiones automáticas de las campeonas como la Critical#47 Express o la SuperCheese Express; genética con alto contenido en CBD seleccionadas para sus versiones de uso medicinal, como la CBD+ Black Widow y las nuevas CBD+ Jack Diesel y CBD+ Caramelice; y ampliando nuestro catálogo con más nuevas variedades como las Ediciones Especiales Positronics Vibes Vol. 1 One Love Haze by Little Pepe y Gordo Master Kush, música reivindicativa y positiva de regalo para semillas revolucionarias.
 
Positronics Seeds ha crecido hasta convertirse en uno de los mejores y más reconocidos bancos de semillas internacionales, como prueban los numerosos premios obtenidos y la lealtad de miles de cultivadores a sus especies únicas.",positronicseeds,31,38/3800ddd9390d4e2e21ab035a1c5c37a56947571b.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/912/avatar/original/Positronics_logo.jpg,positronics_seeds,Positronics Seeds,0,0,positronics-seeds,positronicseeds,https://weedmaps.com/brands/positronics-seeds,https://positronics.eu/,,,,,,,,,,,
1110,"Our Mission:
 
The team at Pot Rocks dedicate themselves to providing the finest high-power, higher-quality alternative medicine to your typical marijuana flower. Using the full authentic profile of the cannabis flower, grown with all-natural and organic processes, Pot Rocks offers a medication with the effects of an entire joint after only one or two hits.
 
History:
 
A collective of owners and patients, Pot Rocks’ founders wanted a stronger product for their higher than average medical conditions where typical marijuana just wouldn’t cut it. Pooling their resources, the Pot Rocks team started researching the best ways to create an all-natural, strain specific and non-artificial alternative that would produce the same intense medication. On April 20th, 2015 (4/20), Pot Rocks officially launched in Southern California, and though they are only in a few dispensaries now, they are quickly making a name for themselves among patients seeking a stronger medication.
 
Process:
 
All of Pot Rock’s flowers are grown in organic water and soil, using entirely vegan materials from the get-go and throughout the harvest process. While several methods of CO2 extractions remove the terpenes from the plant, their extraction process retains as much of the full cannabis profile as possible. This enables the full entourage effect of the plant to get the most out of each strain. Nothing artificial is added, they simply include the plant in its entirety and allow the stronger medication to do its thing.
 
Products:
 
Local Sesh 1st Place ""Best New Product"" 2016
 
Pot Rocks are exactly what they sound like- indoor grown organic flowers, coated with CO2 and kief, all from the same strain. Stored in violet glass containers to best retain their smell, flavor, and potency, Pot Rocks strain specific rocks deliver the powerful high you need with only a small dosage.
 
King Louis OG Pot Rocks
 
Their signature flavor, King Louis OG Pot Rocks combines King Louis OG Flower, coated in King Louis OG Oil (including terpene profile) and rolled in King Louie OG Kief. This King does not mess around, with a high THC and CBD content that packs a powerful punch!
 
Lab Testing:
 
Pot Rocks collaborates with SC Labs to test for the full cannabinoid profile in their products and include detailed descriptions of each strain's’ levels on their packaging, including the THC, CBD, and terpene profile.

Proof is a small family-owned and operated company based in Sonoma County. We aim to make cannabis products more accessible and affordable. We first started making our capsules, tinctures, and topicals for friends and family members, and saw amazing results. However, when we went into dispensaries, it always shocked us to see the expensive prices for CBD and other cannabis products. We decided we could do it better, and much more affordably. Proof products offer all the same benefits you're accustomed to with clean, healthy, cannabis-derived products at a reasonable price.
 
 
 
Our Products
 
Our line of cannabis-infused tinctures and capsules come in a variety of cannabinoid ratios. The goal of this product line is to maximize the therapeutic effects of the plant with cannabinoid ratios that work for a variety of consumers. This line uses cannabis-derived extracts to highlight the natural variety of cannabinoids and encourage the “entourage effect.” We recommend users start with a small dosage and increase based on their own needs and desires.
 
 
 
Our Process 
 
We source our cannabis oil from folks that we know and trust to produce only the highest quality extracts.

4323,"The scientists at Green Therapeutics have been busy in the lab creating a new brand of products called...Provisions. 
 
 
 
The provisions line is focused on providing the everyday customer and patient with the highest quality and convenient ways to medicate. Provisions’ products are focused on elevating life’s adventures through cannabis.
 
 
 
The products in the provisions line includes:
 
 
 
Vape cartridges...
 
Disposable vape pens... 
 
And Dessert oral sprays.
 
 
 
Provisions dessert oral sprays are the next evolution in edibles. They are discreet, great tasting, easy to dose, potent, low calorie and can be added to any food or beverage. We’ve nanoemulsified the formulation which means more potency and faster absorption than normal edibles. Each full spray is accurately dosed at 5mg and come in an assortment of flavors. We also have a high potency formula that is the lowest price per milligram of THC compared to any edible on the market and is dosed at 10mg per spray. Make sure to use caution and treat these sprays as you would any other edible. 
 
 
 
Provisions vape cartridges and disposable vape pens are all ceramic, made from ultra premium distillate, and come in 3 different lines:
 
 
 
Native Terpenes
 
Pure Terpenes
 
And Dessert Infusions
 
 
 
All of Provisions vape lines are uncut and free of PG, VG, MCT or any other diluent. We make sure that all vape flavors are diacetyl free to ensure this is the safest, healthiest option available. 
 
 
 
The Native Terpene line is made of cannabis derived terpenes created through our customized extraction process that collects terpenes in its natural state. Then it’s recombined to make a full flavored, potent, and strain specific pen for all those cannabis lovers.
 
 
 
The Pure Terpene line is created by starting with gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy data from actual cannabis flower samples. That profile is then accurately reconstructed using the same technology, utilizing over 30 pharmaceutical grade terpenes for a precise match. What you get is a strong, great tasting cannabis pen with the entourage effects of specific terpenes.
 
 
 
Finally, the dessert infusions start with our premium undiluted oil. We then have our formulation chemists design custom flavor ingredients in order to create a delicious tasting and discreet vape without sacrificing any potency. What you get is amazing vape flavors without the cannabis smell.
 
 
 
These lines are available in two different hardware options:
 
 
 
A 500mg cartridge that is five ten threaded and can be used with most button style batteries.
 
A 350mg disposable pens that contain approximately 200 puffs.
 
 
 
Whether you choose one of the provisions vape pen lines or the dessert oral sprays you’ll always know that it is manufactured by Green Therapeutics which means you are getting the highest quality product possible.",,82,d8/d8f2e169eeb5557090ab1d02d27f82e3819cac0a.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/004/323/avatar/original/1524173769-Provisions_logo.png,,Provisions,3.93333339691162,11,provisions,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/provisions,,,,,,,,,,,,

We do our best to preserve the full flavor and terpene profiles of the plant. Ripe flowers are harvested, dried and then slow cured on the stem before they are manicured. This allows the flower to mellow out and produce a smooth smoke while keeping its aroma. Flower batches are hen ground and fine sifted to filter out any pieces of stem.

CLEAN GREEN CERTIFIED FARM
The WSLCB rules say that Cannabis cannot be labelled as organic so third party certifiers like Clean Green are applying organic standards to Cannabis and certifying the crop with their label.
Our farm uses no synthetic fertilizers or pesticides
 
ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE
Low carbon footprint: Indoor Cannabis cultivation has been estimated to use 1% of the nation’s power, whereas Sun grown Cannabis uses 95% or more less electrical energy. We use a small amount to sustain our nursery, and some of our greenhouse crops are supplemented with artificial light for part of the year.
 
FLAVOR
Everything we do at Puffin Farm, from strain selection, to our slow cold cure, to our packaging, and finally to our customer, is focused on maximizing flavor, quality, and consumer experience
 
TERPENES
The terpenes which give different strains their taste and smell are well known to effect the high, so the belief that “if it taste good it feels good” is at the core of our product. We grow in the full sun in Eastern Washington in the natural soil, enriched with compost, worm castings, biochar, kelp and humic acids to maximize the rich terpene content.
 
GROWING
We use a lot of beneficial insects, like lacewings and ladybugs, to control insects. When necessary, we use harmless natural products like neem oil and rosemary oil on the vegetative plants to enrich their immune systems before their flowering path.
 
FLOWERING
We never spray anything on the flowers. We let our plants go as long as they need to reach full flavor, and then harvest them and slow cure them in cold dry rooms for weeks to save all those precious terpenes which evaporate with a warm fast dry.
 
CURING
We keep everything in cold storage with as little air as possible and ship it out as soon as it is packaged so we can so you get it in its prime.
 
PACKAGING
We package our products in high quality storage containers to maximize the freshness of our flowers from our farm to your hands.

We are constantly delivering new innovative products to our retail partners and ensuring that a steady supply of our product is readily available to our consumers.",,127,22/2285579f5202588567362f22790f418a9f999a54.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/195/avatar/original/puffin-farm_logo200x200.jpg,,Puffin Farm,4.33333349227905,1,puffin-farm,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/puffin-farm,,,,,,,,,,,,

3087,"WHAT ABOUT US

We rarely think of existence. Where do we come from and why? More importantly where does our weed come from? Do you care? You should care. Even if you care a tiny bit you will have deep love for our flower. All of the water used in our cultivation is collected from the air, we pull no water from California tap. Why? Because a single cannabis plant needs approximately 150-250 gallons of water to reach flowering state. Our cultivation has no runoff; even “safe” fertilizers and nutrients will contaminate surrounding water supplies making life inhabitable for indigenous species. And we love animals. We also love bugs and use them, like rolly pollys, earthworms and nematodes along with friendly bacteria, fungi and protozoa to create a “soil food web” which helps naturally prevent disease and plant-eating predators by working with the plant to provide nutrients and protection. And when we are done we donate all used soil to public parks. Because why not? Parks are great and we should all support them. And yes, we talk to our flower. These thoughtful cultivation practices and the good energy surrounding our flower in their life cycle creates robust terpene profiles, with a strong nose that—when you smoke it—you will understand the world in a different way.




WHAT ABOUT OUR PACKAGING

Our sustainability ethos also applies to our packaging. While we have to package our products in something, we try not to use too much stuff, especially plastic. Most of our packing is paper (as little as possible). We spent a year and a half perfecting a child resistant mylar bag that is made from plant starch and are pretty proud of this. We are not perfect but we are trying. We will never put profits over a clean and beautiful earth.




EQUITY IN THIS INDUSTRY

History

Pure Vape was established in Southern California in 2014. The founders came together to craft 100% organic and solvent-free cannabis extracts. Since the launch of the brand, Pure Vape has taken SoCal by storm. The cannabis community initially took to Pure Vape's sleek design and potent cartridges, and the added transparency of lab tested products solidified the trust among oil enthusiasts. In 2016, Pure Vape was awarded the HempCon Cup for “Best New Product” and “Best Cartridge” at HempCon and has been the California standard since. Today, the Pure Vape team strives to provide the cannabis community with the best, award-winning concentrates on the market. 

Process

Pure Vape products are 100% organic, solvent free cannabis concentrates -- from the distillate to the cartridges, each product is double lab tested. Testing begins with the starting material to ensure the flowers used to craft the concentrates are the clean and potent. Never compromising quality, all triple-distilled concentrates are uncut and free from glycerin or glycols.

Products

Pure Vape products include: THC disposable vaporizers, THC: CBD disposable vaporizers, THC PureOne .5 and 1g cartridges, edible grade THC syringes, custom batteries in an array of colors, and Wally Drops THC and CBD lozenges.

We operate in a manner that actively recognizes the central role that business plays in society by initiating innovative ways to improve quality of life.




Most cannabis users focus on a single cannabinoid: THC. Although an essential component of the L. cannabis sativa plant, it is only one of more than a hundred essential components within the plant. In our extraction processes, our driving focus is to maintain the whole-plant profile, and central to that approach is to capture and retain the most volatile substance that naturally occurs in the plant: terpenoids (aka terpenes). Where other extractors focus on yield and potency, we put those aspects second in importance to the efficacy, flavor, and taste.




For us, extraction is an art -- a craft-- and we cut no corners to ensure every batch is the finest we can make for any particular strain or product. Our extraction techniques allow us to separate out the plant material, waxes and oils to isolate the key ingredients that consumers desire: cannabinoids and terpenoids. Don't take our word for it, judge for yourself.

Pyramid crafts solventless, 100% cannabis extracts that send patients to their very own cloud nine. Combining the belief that every person should be able to find their cloud and the vision of providing high-quality concentrates, Pyramid works diligently to develop the best marijuana products on the market. Pyramid brings refuge through their medical marijuana products, for patients seeking a clean and euphoric high. Feedback from Pyramid patients sing their praises, as Pyramid's sophisticated standards represent cannabis concentrates at the highest level.

History:
Pyramid forged in response to the cloudiness of information between the cannabis community and the extractors who make their medication. The founders felt that the biggest issue in the marijuana industry was the lack of transparency between manufacturers and patients. They set out to create a concentrate brand committed to providing clarity and forthright. Pyramid operates based on the belief that a lack of cohesion in the cannabis industry hurts the progress of legalization. Their team strives to keep Pyramid’s products as superb as possible, as well as nurture the marijuana movement to its fullest potential.

Products:
Pyramid’s concentrates are crafted with hands that have over 15 years of collective experience in marijuana. Their line of Prism concentrates are 100% cannabis, made from hypercritical carbon dioxide extraction. Pyramid's CO2 extraction perfectly preserves the essence of the plant without the use of solvents. Their oil is then re-infused with the terpenes from the original marijuana plant, for robust flavor and effects. Their disposable cartridges present a new level of convenience, bringing the same high-quality cannabis oil but in a easy to use disposable vape pen. Pyramid pens are all strain specific and are available in Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid.

Process:
Pyramid utilizes a CO2 based extraction method to ensure there are zero harmful or unnecessary solvents involved in crafting their concentrates. Nothing artificial goes into their menu of marijuana concentrates, Pyramid is committed to their standard of excellence when developing each of their products. No product makes it onto the Pyramid catalog without undergoing six months of research and development. Pyramid is also based in the most regulated county in Colorado, and have no plans of moving. They are more than happy to continue producing the cleanest and purest extracts as well as perform above and beyond in due diligence.

Lab Testing:
Pyramid is proud to offer the Colorado community cannabis products that are lab-tested through Gobi Analytical. Pyramid’s concentrates are tested for residual solvents as well as potency. Gobi Analytical also occasionally provides Pyramid with terpene profiles to insure the most potent flavors.

Networks:
Colorado patients can find Pyramid products in several dispensaries across the state. Mile High Green Cross and Lodo Wellness Center are two Denver marijuana dispensaries carrying Pyramid. Also, each Starbuds dispensary location including Denver South, Aurora, Bellview, Pueblo, and Vernon carry Pyramid’s concentrates on their menu. Their founders are grateful for the partnerships forged during the beginning of their launch and are most excited for what the future holds. Pyramid loves their Colorado customers and patients, and are interested in expanding into other states where cannabis is legal.",,209,d2/d25f617cfac3d28264b6091c39330fbbcba72f5f.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/259/avatar/original/1620851635-copy_of_pyramid_updated_logo_wname__2_.png,,Pyramid,4,5,pyramid,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/pyramid,,,,,,,,,,,,

History
 
White label blues
 
You may have come across their buds before. The founder of Rad Gardens has been growing for over a decade and supplying dispensaries and deliveries with their quality flowers for many years. Patients began to ask for them, but not by name, since they hadn’t cultivated as an official brand yet. Whatsmore, shops began offering less for flowers. While the cannabis industry boomed, cultivators were using PGR’s to beef up their yields causing a drop in quality and value. The founder was not okay with this; he understood that a decline in the quality of flowers directly affects patients that are relying on cannabis for medicine.
 
 
 
Fat yields are old news!
 
The cannabis community wised up quickly. Now, with the introduction of lab testing, shops and cultivators can no longer pull the wool over people’s eyes. This was great news for Rad Gardens! The founder was extremely excited to bring quality back into the spotlight and officially launched his brand in 2017. Today, Rad Gardens aims to make their premium cannabis flowers available to as many Cali 420 enthusiasts as possible.
 
 
 
Process
 
Rad Gardens is pleased to supply a higher level of quality with their pesticide free flowers. They use an indoor grow facility to produce their flowers for optimal quality control. The founder tailors the environment to influence the plant’s phenotype and deliver the ideal conditions for that strain. Then, their buds are trimmed by hand and slow cured to perfection, yielding beautiful, all natural cannabis.

Rad Gardens offers premium quality cannabis flowers for the most rad of connoisseurs. A favorite among the community being their Blueberry Cookies.

History
 
When the founder of REAL Cultivator was young, he watched friends start their cannabis grows by putting seeds into a paper towel to germinate. From that point on, he was enthralled and sought to learn everything he could about growing marijuana. . The founder, better referred to as Grower K, had been involved in cannabis ever since that fateful day and has devoted his years to discover all he could about cannabis. Since legalization, he noticed a shift in the industry and became disheartened by some of the practices of fellow cultivators and shops. Grower K felt it was time to make a brand of his own, and launched REAL Cultivator in 2017. Today, Grower K is pleased to connect those passionate about cannabis with the best flowers.

Located in the heart of Oregon’s Willamette Valley, our farm is working to preserve the legacy of Uncle Mark, our original rebel. Rebel Spirit is the culmination of years of hard work, determination, and the willingness to overcome the injustices of an oppressive era. Unfortunately, many people have suffered for freedoms that we now enjoy. The spirit of those sacrifices lives on with us now.

 Rebel Spirit believes that everyone has the freedom to choose their own adventure, and we exist to help send them on that journey. We understand that though you, our customer, may have an ‘ordinary’ everyday life, you also have an excitement inside—a rebel, an idea, a creation—that is waiting to be awakened. Rebel Spirit will bring that special ‘something’ to life.

We grow Rebel Spirit products on Uncle Mark’s Farm with you and our planet in mind. We mix our own soil from our farm’s rich earth and organic matter to nurture our cannabis with all-natural nutrients. We hydrate our plants with collected rainwater and water from our farm’s private well, which draws from a deep, pure, and plentiful aquifer. In addition, we recapture and recycle our water to achieve minimal environmental impact. We save electricity by using LED lights for our cannabis grown indoors, and we are working to install solar panels to provide our main source of power. Our packaging is re-usable and recyclable. When you choose Rebel Spirit, you are making an environmentally responsible decision.

 Rebel Spirit produces only top-quality cannabis. We understand that our customers have differing needs. We provide you with a variety of superior strains, each filled with a plethora of cannabinoids and created to breathe life into your adventure. Our cannabis strains are designed to fulfill your recreational and/or medical needs. Whether you choose the pure passion and euphoria of our rich sativas, the deep and relaxing calm of our smooth indicas, or the transcendent balance of our hybrids, we have a strain cultivated especially for you. Uncle Mark would be proud that his seeds have taken root, are growing, and are embodied in our Rebel Spirit.

 Each of us has a connection to something that gives our lives meaning. Here at Rebel Spirit, our connection—our purpose—is you. Decades ago, a rebel very dear to us planted an idea that has rooted itself within the foundation of this company. In the past, that idea was not widely accepted, and many sought to subdue it, but we are here to share the vision of naturally-grown, quality cannabis with you in this new era.",,66,69/698a37fb92dc742ec4735c803ba5c451a4d3660d.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/360/avatar/original/1600212473-Gold_Seal_with_TM.png,,Rebel Spirit,4.33333349227905,1,rebel-spirit,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/rebel-spirit,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Medicine Woman offers concentrates, tinctures, and cartridges with incredible flavor and aroma. Their specialty is using unique, deliciously flavored terpenes to produce an experience with potency and exotic flavor profile. Their mission is to provide California patients and marijuana enthusiasts with high-quality cannabis products. With the fundamental belief that medical marijuana is a natural medicine that can address the entire body, mind, and spirit, The Medicine Woman’s cannabis cultivators and artisan extractors devote themselves to curating the purest, cleanest marijuana products.
 
 
 
History
 
The Medicine Woman began in 2015 from a husband and wife delivery service turned cannabis concentrates company. The founder grew up around marijuana, his father was a cultivator and fully advocated the medical use of marijuana. Even though growing up with cannabis around, the founder did not immediately follow in his father’s footsteps. He started his career in the clothing industry and after successfully running an apparel brand felt the need to shift his focus to cannabis. Growing up in a family of growers came in handy, and he was eager to apply his knowledge of cannabis to the new techniques of extraction. The result was The Medicine Woman; a concentrates company serving the medical marijuana community extracts with full-bodied flavor and potency.
 
 
 
Products
 
The Medicine Woman has the concentrates for on the go patients, their Live Resin cartridges pack 90% THC and produce beautiful, thick clouded hits. Their shatter gives patients something to boast about as well, such as their Blueberry Haze Klear Shatter. This distillate is a Sativa dominant hybrid with earthy, blueberry terpenes. The Medicine Woman is the queen of cartridges, offering several delicious live resin strains in convenient half and one gram cartridges. Patients have Lavender Gelato Live Resin, Rootbeer, Jungle Juice in Indica and CBD cartridges, and plenty more to choose from. Those that need a drop of relief can turn to The Medicine Woman’s tinctures for aid. Their line of 50mg THC edible cannabis comes in Apple Martini, Strawberry, and Blueberry Haze. Drip into food or beverage for an instant custom edible patients can dose to their needs.
 
 
 
Process
 
Crafting their shatter and distillate concentrates requires a powerful combination of Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Microwave Hydro diffusion and Gravity technologies to extract raw Delta 9 THC and essential cannabinoids. All concentrates from The Medicine Woman are guaranteed to have no less than 80% THC; ensuring a consistently potent concentrate with full-bodied flavor.
 
 
 
Lab Testing
 
The Medicine Woman proudly offers lab tested shatter, distillate, vape pens, and tinctures. They test their products through Cannalysis and occasionally SC Labs. Each of their medical cannabis products receives full spectrum testing, including purity, potency, and terpene profiles.",,715,7e/7e8554caae527aa4c6398f50f94b3e52e891fbc9.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/494/avatar/original/the-medicine-woman_bigger-small-logo_2.jpg,,The Medicine Woman,4.9375,9,the-medicine-woman,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/the-medicine-woman,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Originals Cannabis Company was founded in the midst of prohibition under the California medical-marijuana voter initiative. We have not only personally experienced the wellness that cannabis offers, but also witnessed cannabis perform what could only be described as miracles in cases where modern medicine failed or worse – was priced above the cost of life. The solution was as obvious then as it is now.




Since 2006, our ambition has remained the same — to create a better life for people by offering exceptional cannabis at such fair prices that as many people as possible can afford to buy it. While we aren’t clever enough to solve world peace, we are pretty sure that Biggie and Tupac (RIP)would have found some common ground in their approval of The Originals.

Offering premium concentrates, infused chews, capsules, tinctures, and more, Theory Wellness is a brand of high-quality cannabis products, presented in sleek, discreet packaging. 
 
Process
 
Theory Wellness produces their cannabis oil from their in-house cultivation facility, employing small batch cultivation methods. By growing their flowers in smaller batches, Theory Wellness has larger quality control over the environmental conditions of their cannabis. That, in turn, produces better, fuller, and more resinous flowers. They then craft their flowers into strain specific oils to effectively develop products that meet particular needs. Theory Wellness uses Supercritical CO2 extraction to create their cannabis oil to produce clean marijuana oil, free from residual solvents. The resulting cannabis oil is then blended into their line of gummies, tinctures, and capsules, all convenient and easy to dose products.
 
Products
 
Theory Wellness offers a menu comprised of premium extracts (Vape Cartridges, Rosin, Sap, Kief) as well as marijuana-infused gummies, tinctures, and capsules to meet the divergent needs of the diverse cannabis community. 
 
Lab Testing
 
Theory Wellness is pleased to offer lab tested marijuana products conducted by MCR Labs.

Tiger Vape Hemp Oil is pain’s worst enemy; passionate about providing quick, effective, and clean CBD oil to patients suffering from debilitating pain. Their focus is on the amazing medical benefits of CBD, and all of their products are rich in it; making pain management painless. Tiger Vape Hemp Oil cartridges hit smoothly, without any of the harshness of traditional smoking products. Allowing people suffering from severe pain an easy and powerful way to be relieved from their ailment immediately.
 
History:
 
Tiger Vape Hemp Oil believes that it should be the choice of the patient to have access to CBD rich cannabis products. Noticing that most clinics mostly provide THC heavy cannabis, Tiger Vape Hemp Oil began to fill an important void in the medical marijuana market. The founder of Tiger Vape Hemp Oil has experienced first hand the effect that CBD can have on someone's life. His very own father was suffering from Parkinson's disease, and had to rely entirely on his family to perform simple tasks. Seeking alternative medicine that would not damage his liver or kidneys the way most prescription drugs do, they turned to medical marijuana. However, the psychoactive effects of THC were not helpful to his father. So he set out in search for strains of hemp that were low THC and high CBD. After visiting many different countries including China and Australia the founder was finally able to craft his special CBD blend and created Tiger Vape Hemp Oil.
 
Now, Tiger Vape Hemp Oil is dedicated to providing CBD rich hemp oil to those restricted by chronic pain. Their mission is help patients regain their independence and freedom from their debilitating health ailments. Tiger Vape Hemp Oil believes that CBD is the future of medicine and is proud to be at the forefront of the CBD and Hemp community, with their brand new, groundbreaking product.
 
Process:
 
Tiger Vape Hemp Oil is dedicated to being transparent and honest about all of their products. All of their products are tested through SC Labs, one of the nation's leaders in cannabis science. Tiger Vape Hemp Oil tests for CBD, THC, and CBN content, to ensure that patients are receiving safe and trustworthy products. They use a CO2 extraction method, which is much safer than other wax or concentrate extractions. The CO2 method uses Supercritical Fluid Extraction or SFE which leaves out harmful hexane and methylene chemicals other types of extractions have.
 
Products:
 
Mama’s Herbal CBD Oil pre-filled cartridges pack a huge punch to pain. This super smooth concentrate won’t hurt your throat when inhaling the way traditional medical marijuana does when smoked. A few puffs depending on patient size and ailment severity and your pain will melt away. Mama’s Herbal CBD Oil comes in four flavors; Citrus Punch, Fruit Punch, Hemp Original and Tropical Fruit.

Tinman Oil *5X Award Winner* in Best Concentrate Category
 
Mission
 
Tinman Oil is the right choice for Quality, Potency, and Wellness. Our mission is to set a new standard through the cannabis industry, by nourishing people's lives with the highest quality concentrate at a affordable cost to the consumer. Putting patients before profit, one dab at a time.
 
History in the Making
 
Tinman Oil is one of the first original extract companies that bursted on the scene in 2015. The company had aspirations to create a premium, high quality cannabis product, with a price point that could still appeal to the average cannabis consumer. Which is why till this day, they are renowned for having the highest quality trim run shatter on the market. Upon their first production run, they immediately began to generate a buzz in the cannabis community. Providing cannabis connoisseurs from all over with some of the best quality shatter coming out of the San Fernando Valley. Tinman then decided to put their quality to the test, by competing for Best Concentrate at the 1st annual 805 Oilers Fest in 2015. The outcome was no fluke, Tinman Oil was awarded top three positioning in every concentrate category. Taking 1st place in best Hybrid Concentrate, beating out Nature's Lab & Dopey Extracts, in collaboration with Apothecary 420 and their Gorilla Mints strain. While also taking 3rd place in Best Indica Concentrate, awarding Cali Kush Farms their 1st ever award for their Kosher OG. Awards kept piling up for company, finally taking 3rd Place in Best Sativa Concentrate with Agent Tangie. The company's reputation was then solidified for having some of the highest quality concentrates available on the market. Later on that year, Tinman Oil then took home two more awards at 805 Invades LA Fest. Placing 2nd in Best Concentrate in both Indica and Sativa, with their immensely popular, Alpha OG & Hi-C flower strains.
 
Quality & Safety
 
To be the best, you need to work with the best. Tinman Oil extracts all their product with a state of the art closed looped system, along with a industry standard vacuum purging process. To guarantee that you're left with a product that is has been carefully crafted for safe consumption. Without leaving behind harmful contaminants that can cause you damaging side effects. All our concentrates are made with premium flower, picked for maximum THC & terpene content. Tinman Oil will be fully compliant with all upcoming California recreational regulations.

869,"“Cultivated with Love & Curated for the Community!”

 

In the emerald hills of the Pacific Northwest lies one of the finest cannabis gardens to date. TJ’s Gardens was founded by two advocates who were dedicated to their love of cannabis and their care for the community. Together, they’ve created a brand that provides an excellent selection of flower, extracts, and edibles. TJ’s Gardens invites Oregon patients and adult users to enjoy the sensations and flavors of craft, award-winning cannabis.

 

History

Named after its two founders, Travis MacKenzie and James Orpeza, TJ’s Gardens was established to share the benefits of medicinal cannabis. Travis found his way into the cannabis industry as a means to help his wife, Cham. She was suffering from debilitating headaches from a brain injury she sustained in a car accident. Her neurologist suggested medical cannabis, so Travis began to cultivate a few plants. The couple saw an incredible difference, which inspired Travis to impact the lives of others by cultivating medicinal cannabis. James is a long-time master grower who lent his expertise to small medical grow-ops for many years. When James and Travis met, it was clear that their combination of passion and talent would be a real game-changer for Oregon’s cannabis community.

 

With more than 25 years of cannabis cultivation in his wheelhouse, James put together a “beyond organic” cultivation approach for TJ’s Gardens. Along the journey, TJ's Gardens has won over thirty awards at notable events and competitions, such as the High Times Cannabis Cup, Dope Cup, and NW Cannabis Classic, just to name a few. To this day, Travis and James still remain hands-on in the garden and extraction lab alongside a dedicated team of growers and extractors. Together, they carry out what is indeed a labor of love.

 

Process

TJ’s Gardens operates under the philosophy that every plant deserves to reach its full genetic potential, which is why they cultivate using a technique known as regenerative no-till living soil. Each plant is provided the utmost care and attention to detail, from the organic nutrients in the soil to the watering and light cycles. After harvest and curing their buds to perfection, they are sent for lab testing to ensure only the cleanest and safest flowers make it to market.

 

Products

TJ’s Gardens’ genetic offerings constantly evolve, but always uphold the highest quality standards. Explore some of their popular cultivars, including TJ’s Blue Dream, TJ's Durban Poison, TJ's Dark Star and TJ's Purple Kush.",,712,8f/8f4a0bb7988e474917936bf7d5a14c4c99f0e9a8.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/000/869/avatar/original/tj_s-gardens-provisions_logo.jpg,,TJ's Gardens,4.82183885574341,5,tjs-gardens,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/tjs-gardens,,,,,,,,,,,,
232,"TKO Products is one of the oldest and most recognized cannabis brands in California. Our vision is to use our passion for quality, potency and flavor to deliver the very best edibles, concentrates, vaporizers and cannabis-infused products on the market.
 
Established in 2011, initially, 'TKO Edibles' was created for dispensaries that we personally managed, when the clinics were forced to close we began soliciting our baked goods to other clinics.
 
TKO now includes a dedicated team to maintain, produce, and grow our business even further.
 
What we discovered as clinic managers, edible consumers, and finally as producers of edibles, is that there is a need for consistently potent products with a good price point. One of the biggest complaints from clinic owners is that edible products were 'inconsistent in potency' and unreliable when it came to deliveries by the vendors.
 
With the new rules for the legal cannabis market changing the maximum THC content allowed in edibles to 100mg, TKO is still formulating products for our former customers who have higher THC tolerance levels. Our baked goods, brownies and cookies, will be the same size as before and come with a template to portion the product to the THC size that's right for you. If you can handle 100mg, you will need to eat only one TKO cookie, instead of 10 of the competition's cookies. Calories matter!
 
We have products for the micro-dose crowd also, and soon will be adding more! Micro-dosers will fall in love with our premium chocolate, available in both creamy milk and delicious dark chocolate.

1912,"We have been breeding cannabis for more than 20 years. We follow the underground growers´tradition and use their experience. We have been cooperating with Ruderalis since 1998.
We gained the cannabis genetics mostly from sailors from Amsterdam and Hamburg. Some kinds of sativa come from African students at University of Agriculture. Another ones were brought from India and Near East, part of them originates from the Swiss Alps.
Since we love breeding and we had seen the necessity to shorten maturing, we have started to produce regular seeds of autoflowering varieties. Thus we avoid cold and wet autumn. The final selection of suitable plants is done under extreme conditions, right in the fields, without any fertilizing and pesticide use. The plants are not even pre-grown. Such strains are suitable for outdoor breeding, with 99% germination capacity, resistant to stress, nutrients shortage. ...and with excellent yield.
From regular seeds you can grow high-quality plants with better qualities in comparison to feminized seeds. For those plant breeders who want to grow another hybrids and varieties the regular seeds are the real challenge. By selecting and pollinating plants you can get enough seeds for your friends .Sowing regular seeds is the right thing- return to the roots and nature. By this you bring cannabis back to the place where it belongs to.
If you are environment friendly, alternative but conservative at the same time, interested in sustainable life on Earth, do not hesitate and breed bio and regular seeds!
Its not only our success at Cannabis Cup that shows that these seeds are worth it.
 
TTS-100% natural and regular seeds.
 
 
 

Hemos estado cultivando cannabis por más de 20 años. Seguimos la tradición de los cultivadores subterráneos y usamos su experiencia. Hemos estado cooperando con Ruderalis desde 1998.
Ganamos la genética del cannabis en su mayoría de marineros de Amsterdam y Hamburgo. Algunos tipos de sativa vienen de estudiantes africanos en la Universidad de Agricultura. Otros fueron traídos de la India y el Cercano Oriente, parte de ellos tienen origen de los Alpes suizos.
Ya que nos encanta la cría y habíamos visto la necesidad de acortar la maduración, hemos comenzado a producir semillas regulares de variedades autoflorecientes. Así evitamos el frío y el otoño húmedo. La selección final de plantas adecuadas se realizan en condiciones extremas, en el campo, sin ningún tipo de fertilización y uso de pesticidas. Las plantas no son ni siquiera crecidas anteriormente. Tales cepas son adecuadas para la cría al aire libre, con una capacidad de germinación del 99%, resistente al estrés, escasez de nutrientes. ... y con excelente rendimiento.
De semillas regulares puede cultivar plantas de alta calidad con mejores calidades en comparación con las semillas feminizadas. Para los cultivadores que quieren cultivar otros híbridos y variedades las semillas regulares son el verdadero desafío. Al seleccionar y polinizar las plantas puede obtener suficientes semillas para sus amigos. Siendo semillas regulares es lo correcto: regrese a las raíces y la naturaleza. Con esto traes cannabis de vuelta al lugar que pertenece.
Si eres bastante amigable con el medio ambiente, pero conservador al mismo tiempo, y interesado en la vida sostenible en la Tierra. ¡No dudes en reproducir semillas biológicas y regulares!

It’s all in the name, TRADITIONAL™. Who we are and what we do is synonymous with loyalty and trust. Born and bred in Los Angeles in 2005, our ethos has always been to exceed and set the standards for the cannabis industry. Alongside other brands and operators, we’ve all matured and grown together symbiotically while assisting each other in our successes. We’re not in the business of competition, but in the business of unification and the elevation of all like-minded parties. We believe in honoring Traditions. From seed to sale, from CEO to customer, everybody on our team is part of our family.







PASS IT ON

Los Angeles born and bred, we are here to lift up our hometown community by employing the members of our communities, while simultaneously continuing our growth of interest in connecting more with the great people of this city. When we say Pass It On, we’re not just referring to rotation etiquette. We say it more as a calling, a duty to pass on our virtues and build a new generation of people steeped in the Tradition of keeping legacy cannabis authentic and in the hands of those that will build what is to come. We are Traditional. Pass It On.







PASSION

From our food to our friends, we value quality. And when it comes to cannabis, we only grow and cultivate what we too would consume. Our product has to match our passion. Similar to the growth of our plants, we started from our roots and slowly rose to the light. We are where we are because we truly believe that passion is the force that empowers our drive and keeps our Earth moving. We have and will continue to dedicate ourselves to delivering the purest and cleanest cannabis as far as the nose can smell.







LEGACY

Before our brand came to fruition, we soaked up the plant’s heritage by working with old-school growers with knowledge. Their interest and insight were invaluable in assisting us to create and produce the finest herb. As laws and regulations hardened over the past two decades, we’ve witnessed, endured, and persevered above any opposition due to the legitimate and honorable business ethics that we hold ourselves accountable to. The universal truth ‘as above, so below’ runs fervently throughout all that we make and produce. Staying close to our roots is the foundation on which we built this company on.







HONOR

Slow and steady wins the race. Here at Traditional we’ve created our own process and pace that allows us to stay current with an ever-changing climate and upkeep demand without compromising quality. We never rush or extend ourselves too far, we Trust The Process. Delivering the best cannabis in the industry means being actively involved and thorough with each step and every aspect of the process. Away from the noise, we’ve supplied licensed cannabis to equally respectable brands with intent on aiding their process. These relationships have flourished from friendship to kindredship.




QUALITY

We have researchers that explore ways to innovatively access and ultimately customize the genetic makeup of the cannabis plant. Our farmers then plant these new ideas and bring them to fruition.

Our Product:

While developing our product, we followed a simple philosophy. We didn’t let the prices of our competitors determine our product. Instead, we let our product dictate our price. This allowed us the ability to spare no expense and gather the best ingredients we could find. Our material is sourced from a network of reputable growers and is always tested for pesticides. Our concentrate is then extracted using state of the art co2 extractors and refined through molecular distillation resulting in a clear bright golden concentrate that tests 90% - 95%. With molecular distillation we are also able to capture the plant's natural terpenes which are reintroduced into our concentrate for a powerful entourage effect. Finally our concentrates are tested tested for potency, pesticides, residual solvents, and terpene profile ensuring you that we have a pure and safe product.",,27,ed/ed4fb5c2d243d6bff34c1a7f0ecba58ca13ba6ad.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/002/744/avatar/original/weedmaps_logo.jpg,,Tranquilizer,4.96875,0,tranquilizer,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/tranquilizer,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discover concentrates rooted in wellness with Tree Base Klear’s line of clear, potent, and terpy cannabis extractions. Tree Base Klear is a pioneer in concentrates --one of the first to bring clear, distillate concentrates to the market. Tree Base Klear’s line of vape cartridges and klear syringes delivers a clean high every time. Tree Base supplies extracts upon which the cannabis community can rely, and their methods render consistent extracts that express the essence of the original strain in every puff.
 
 
 
History:
 
Tree Base Klear was founded on a ground-breaking formula. The founders have been around cannabis for most of their lives, and have more than a decade of experience in the industry. Tree Base Klear’s co-founder and chemist developed a method that produced colorless, odorless, waterclear distillate. They both knew they’d stumbled upon something that ought to be shared. Tree Base Klear partners identified a hole in the market and wanted to bring something to the cannabis extraction market that would raise the bar.
 
For the Tree Base Klear co-founders, the cannabis industry is not a trend, or about turning a profit, it is a lifestyle. Tree Base Klear launched in 2015, debuting their waterclear extractions to concentrate enthusiasts throughout California. Their clear distillate concentrates blew extraction standards out of the water, but reshaping the narrative about distillate was an uphill battle. With much patience and an eagerness to educate, it was only a matter of time before the cannabis community gave them a try and fell in love. Since their launch, the founders and Tree Base Klear team have proudly supplied their patrons premium cannabis extractions. Today, the founders invite the cannabis community to experience what their products have to offer. Go on and take a puff, this difference is klear.
 
 
 
Process:
 
Tree Base Klear’s extraction artist employs proprietary extraction methods to craft a klear line of concentrates. Their focus is refinement, and their hallmark is purity. Tree Base Klear sources starting material from a network of cannabis gardens they trust. Tree Base Klear flowers are come from Master Growers the founders have longstanding relationship with, and hold to the same level of standards as their extraction process. From soil to oil, Tree Base Klear material and products exude perfection and purity.",,2147,5c/5c56627aea7574a76ef59671e5708ae573961beb.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/070/avatar/original/1529350222-TBK_Avatar2.jpg,,Tree Base Klear,4.75499057769775,75,tree-base,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/tree-base,,,,,,,,,,,,

1253,"INTRODUCTION
 
Our Project, Tropical Seeds Company, started with the firm goal of preserving and maintaining the diversity of Cannabis Sativa L in a world where the local genetics are being lost.
 
In our experience, we feel that things done with special care and love always give the best results. Our seeds are produced organically in small batches which are kept in the best conditions. Every lot is labelled and easy to identify trough a code of its own
 
We are working hard as to give the best experience when acquiring and growing our strains. This is why we are always in a constant search of the best aromas, flavours and effects. Our main strength is starting with pure - landrace genetics with a whole new world of possibilities, away from the commercial offers.
 
HISTORY
 
Tropical Seeds Company was first presented publicly in the year 2008. The previous years were intense and harsh as to make the project possible. From the first beginning, the base was chosen to be local – pure strains, being sativas the most numerous. These genetics had proven to be a great psychoactive resource for the locals that had used these plants for long. The final goal was to collect, understand and breed them as to keep alive these lines and make them available to the connoiseurs enjoying the most unique and special effects.
 
Some excellent facilities based on subtropical climate were chosen as to make the project possible. The Canary Islands ( 28º N ) was the place where the charm started. A wide selection of different genetics, coming from the best sources and growers, were spread in some huge greenhouses. It was Maxi HdB who first started this growing and breeding work, joined by aeritos some years later as to continue with the strength and vitality needed inside Tropical Seeds Company.
 
Tons of dedication and thoughtful work later, once most of the non desirable traits were removed, a visible stock of a renewed genetic reserve arose and created the base to continue the project. Exotic flavours and infrequent highs were already giving refreshing experiences to the smokers. These steps ahead helped Tropical Seeds Company to upgrade into a solid company of the cannabis scene, focused on improving local, pure African strains.

Exploring the untapped potential of marijuana, Uncle D’s offers finely crafted and cultivated cannabis flower to those in search of a great smoke. Uncle D’s flowers span the spectrum of marijuana consumers, and whether in medical need or seeking a potent high, Uncle D’s aromatic and palatable cannabis offers an experience both excellent and affordable.
 
History:
 
Uncle D’s began as a brand in late 2016 but sprung from experienced growers with nearly twenty years of cultivation experience. For years, the founding team of Uncle D’s anonymously distributed their flowers and served southern Orange County patients through their delivery service. When they found success, they realized there was an untapped market of suffering patients with whom Uncle D’s wanted to share their cannabis medicine. After years of perfecting their growing methods, Uncle D’s launched in 2016 so patients could recognize their high-quality flowers, and they are slowly expanding their operations to serve more and more consumers throughout Southern California.
 
Products:
 
Uncle D’s flowers stand apart from the crowd thanks to their unique methods of growing and flushing and their exotic strains and genetics. They complete a full fourteen-day flush cycle, absolutely ensuring the flower they produce is clean, potent and flavorful. With a number of in-house genetics, Uncle D’s carried their Blackberry strain for over ten years, continually refining their phenotypes to attain the optimum version of this fruity Indica. Patients also love their Berkeley strain, a heavy-hitting hybrid with a unique palate of flavors.
 
Lab Testing:
 
Uncle D’s is committed to offering their patients the highest quality flower possible and works with independent laboratories to test their cannabis for potency, pesticides, and mold/mildew residuals.
 
Networks:
 
Currently, Uncle D’s cannabis lines the shelves of deliveries and dispensaries in Southern Orange County, available to patients in Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, Dana Point and Aliso Viejo. They look forward to expanding throughout the remainder of Orange County, as well as partnering with other brands to advanced the cannabis industry and their product selection.",,58,fa/fa26f6128a96712d83a04d62de51ebf08b7e3801.jpg,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/740/avatar/original/uncle-d_s_logo.jpg,,Uncle D's,4.75,2,uncle-ds,,https://weedmaps.com/brands/uncle-ds,,,,,,,,,,,,

15627,"Unicorn Tears is an independent craft cannabis producer local to Southern, ME. We are focused on pheno-hunting and breeding projects, and work obsessively to provide a unique flavor experience for patients. Putting together an eclectic mix of strains that “check every box”, there is genuinely something for every circumstance all within our menu. This goes for both flavor desires and medicinal needs. 

 

 Our genetics have won multiple awards to this point, including 1st Place in the 2019 Terp Town Throwdown for a dried flower with Creme Fraiche, 2nd place is 2018 Canna Allstars for a dried flower with ForZiato, and 3rd Place in the 2019 Terp Town Throwdown for Live Resin with ForZiato. 

Over time, we will introduce more and more in-house bred cultivars to the market. 




 Our growing methods consist of a hybridized program functioning in soilless media, using extremely low EC values, Korean Natural Farming techniques, and many inputs that are typically introduced in living soil applications. All of these efforts are done with the goal of maximizing oils, improving flavor, improving smokability, and maximizing medicinal properties via increasing the Brix content of the fruit.

URSA is a discovery brand driven by innovation reliant on Expertise made possible by Humboldt’s accumulated knowledge.

We start with the finest California whole fresh frozen sun-grown Cannabis flower, to create our concentrate products. Our Humboldt-trained technicians use cannabinoid and terpene preserving extraction techniques to highlight each plant’s unique profile.Our products are produced in single-strain, single-source, andsmall batches that preserve the grower’s vision. All of our products are full-spectrum concentrates that feature 69-98% THC and the highest level of terpene preservation possible. We aim to educate you on what to look for in your cannabis products.

Liquid Diamond Sauce Cartridges

Our Liquid Diamond Sauce Cartridges are unlike any other on the market. We create all of our diamond carts with the best processes out now. We use the BHO extraction method. In this process, we flash freeze all parts of high-quality single-strain cannabis. Through a closed-loop system, the butane solvent is washed over the frozen flower and isolates cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids. The extracted oil is then purged of the solvent. Since the plant material is frozen at the time of harvest, there are no additional refinements needed for pure live-resin carts. When you use one of our Cartridges, we can ensure you that you are only inhaling the purest, most potent part of the cannabis plant. We never mix or blend strains in any of our products. All of our full spectrum Liquid Diamond Sauce Cartridges are pure Live Resin put in an on-the-go pen format. With our high concentrates of up to 98%, we can ensure when you use a URSA Liquid Diamond Sauce Cartridge you get the full cannabis experience but without the extra prep. We fill all our THC live resin oils in medical-grade ceramic cartridges, to give you the purest taste on demand.




URSA NOVAterps Diamond Cartridge

 Our NOVAterps Diamond Cartridge is hands-down, the best cartridge our Extractors have ever made. Why? Two ingredients: NOVAterps & Live Resin Diamonds.

URSA NOVAterps Diamond Cartridge is a high potency, amazing flavor, and unmatched purity. It is distillate-free, CRC-free, single-source, from the fresh flower, and it tastes amazing. All in the convenience of a fully ceramic 510 thread cartridge. 




 Fully Ceramic Hardware

We were the first concentrate brand to use Fully Ceramic hardware for all our products. We believe using ceramic prevents harmful chemicals and leaching from metal over time. Ceramic hardware also helps to highlight the unique taste of the cannabis plant oil in every strain produced.




 TrueLive Concentrates

Our TrueLive Resins, diamond sauce, and badder are made with BHO processes. We pride ourselves on being innovators in the industry by using the most oil and the best systems to extract our high THC diamond concentrates.

Wir sind stets bemüht unsere Produktpalette unserer Qualitäts-Produkte zu erweitern.
 
VAPOR SPIRIT CBD Öl gehört zu den CBD-Ölen mit den höchsten Qualitätsstandards, die der CBD Markt momentan hergibt.
 
 
 
Die Qualität der aktuell verfügbaren Produkte, die auf CBD basieren, kann sehr stark variieren. Leider wurden einige CBD Produkte gefunden, in denen gar kein CBD war oder sie waren mit Pestiziden, Pilzen und / oder mit Bakterien kontaminiert, was dem Zweck der Verwendung von CBD entgegensteht.
 
 
 
Daher ist es Vapor Spirit wichtig, ausschließlich und ausnahmslos qualitativ hochwertige CBD Produkte zu produzieren. Vapor Spirit Öle werden zu 100% aus biologischem, in der Schweiz angebauten und lizensierten Hanf gewonnen!
 
 
 
Es werden absolut keine Pestizide oder anderen Chemikalien verwendet und es wird anhand Labortests gewährleistet, dass die CBD Öle immer die angegebene Wirksamkeit haben und die gesetzlich festgelegte THC Grenze nicht überschritten wird. 
 
 
 
Garantiert frisch und Rohkost-Qualität!
 
 
 
Für unsere Produktion nutzen wir ausschliesslich biologische Blüten aus aktueller Ernte, welche direkt nach der Ernte unter strenger Kontrolle bis 27 °C kalt extrahiert und abgefüllt (ohne Zusätze). 
 
 
 
Ultra Premium CBD Öl in absoluter Spitzenqualität 100% SWISS MADE!
 
 
 
Das Öl wurde sorgfältig mit Bio-MCT hergestellt, dessen Eigenschaften perfekte Übereinstimmung haben mit Cannabis-Extraktionen (CBD), es macht Sie leicht resorbierbar.
 
 
 
Es enthält das gesamte Spektrum der Wirkung des Extraktes aus Hanf: Cannabinoide, Terpene, Sesquiterpene und Flavonoide, wie CBC Cannabichromen, CBG Cannabigerol, CBDV Cannabidivarin, ß-Caryophyllen und die wertvollen Omega 3 + 6 Fettsäuren, um ein sehr breites Wirkungsspektrum zu gewährleisten, deshalb sind unsere Öle auch etwas dickflüssiger als andere. Somit kein einseitiges Isolat!
 
 
 
VAPOR SPIRIT CBD Öl zu 100% aus der Blüte gewonnen ohne Zusätze. Ein absolutes Naturprodukt der Spitzenklasse.
 
+ bedeutet das der Wert über dem Angegebenen Prozentsatz ist somit ein +Plus für Sie.
